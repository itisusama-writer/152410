# CHAPTER 1 - THE ROAD TO NARAN

The coaster bus groaned as it climbed another winding turn, its engine straining against the incline. Inside, the smell of diesel fumes mixed with the floral sweetness of someone's perfume and the sharp tang of oranges being peeled three rows back. Areeba pressed her forehead against the cold metal railing of the seat in front of her, trying to find relief from the pressure building behind her eyes.

"You okay?" her Aunt Fareeda asked, adjusting the dupatta that kept sliding off her shoulder. She sat wedged between Areeba and the window, occasionally pointing out scenery nobody could properly see through the dust-filmed glass.

"Just a headache," Areeba mumbled, not lifting her head. The railing felt like ice against her skin, a small mercy in the stuffy bus. Outside, the Punjab plains had given way to rocky terrain, the landscape transforming with every kilometer that brought them closer to Naran.

Across the aisle, her sister Ayesha was scrolling through her phone, trying to catch the last bars of signal before they ventured deeper into the mountains. The rest of the family, Uncle Jamil, Aunt Sadia, and the kids, occupied the seats behind them, their chatter creating a constant buzz of excitement.

"Lahore seems like days ago already," Aunt Fareeda said, fanning herself with a magazine. "These trips always feel longer than they are."

Areeba didn't respond. The headache had sharpened into something else, a strange hollowness spreading through her limbs. The bus hit a pothole, and the jolt sent a wave of nausea through her stomach. She kept her forehead pressed to the railing, her breathing shallow.

The pressure built. And built.

And then, nothing.

---

"Areeba?"

The voice sounded distant, muffled, like someone calling from underwater.

"Areeba!"

Louder now. Sharper.

Ayesha looked up from her phone, her thumb frozen mid-scroll. She'd heard Aunt Fareeda call her sister's name three times now, each repetition climbing in pitch. Something in that tone made her stomach tighten.

"What's wrong?" Ayesha asked, pulling out her earbuds.

Aunt Fareeda's face had gone pale. "She's not answering." Her hand hovered over Areeba's shoulder, uncertain. "I thought she was just sleeping, butâ€”"

"Areeba!" Ayesha leaned across the aisle, her voice cutting through the ambient noise of the bus. The chatter behind them stuttered, then died.

No response.

Aunt Fareeda grabbed Areeba's shoulder and pulled her upright. Her niece's head lolled backward, boneless, her eyes rolled up so only the whites showed. A thin line of saliva glistened at the corner of her slack mouth.

"Ya Allah!" Aunt Sadia gasped from the seat behind.

The bus suddenly felt too small, the air too thick. Aunt Fareeda's hands trembled as she shook Areeba's shoulders. "Beta! Beta, wake up!"

Nothing. Areeba was completely motionless, a ragdoll in her aunt's arms.

"What happened? What's going on?" Uncle Jamil pushed forward, his bulky frame blocking the narrow aisle.

"She fainted!" Ayesha was already digging through her bag. "Does anyone have water?"

A bottle appeared, thrust forward by shaking hands. Aunt Fareeda unscrewed it with fumbling fingers, water sloshing over the rim. She sprinkled it on Areeba's face, once, twice, three times. The droplets rolled down her niece's cheeks like tears, but Areeba remained still as stone.

"More water!" Uncle Jamil commanded. "Driver, stop the bus!"

"I can't stop here, sahib!" the driver called back, not taking his eyes off the twisting road. "There's no shoulder. We're fifteen minutes from the rest stop!"

"Then drive faster!" Aunt Sadia's voice cracked.

Ayesha dampened her dupatta and pressed it against Areeba's forehead, her own heart hammering against her ribs. Her sister's skin felt wrong, too cold, too clammy. "Areeba, come on. Wake up. *Please.*"

The bus careened around another bend. Someone in the back was reciting Ayat al-Kursi, the prayer barely audible over the engine's roar.

Then...

Areeba's eyelids fluttered.

A collective breath released.

Her eyes opened slowly, unfocused, pupils dilated and dark. She blinked once, twice, looking around at the circle of frightened faces hovering over her as if she'd never seen them before.

"What..." Her voice came out hoarse, confused. "What happened?"

"You fainted, beta!" Aunt Fareeda's relief came out as anger. "You scared us half to death! What's wrong with you?"

Areeba's hand drifted to her forehead. The wet dupatta slid off, landing in her lap. "I don't... I don't know. I just felt dizzy and then..." She trailed off, her brow furrowing.

"When did you eat last?" Uncle Jamil demanded. "Did you have breakfast?"

"I... yes. I had parathas. And chai." Areeba tried to sit up straighter, but Aunt Fareeda held her shoulder.

"Easy, easy. Don't move too fast."

"Maybe it's car sickness," Ayesha offered, though she didn't sound convinced. "The roads are pretty bad."

"Or dehydration," Uncle Jamil said, nodding as if he'd diagnosed the problem. "These long trips, people forget to drink water. Here..." He pushed the bottle into Areeba's hands. "Drink."

Areeba obeyed, taking small sips. Color was slowly returning to her face, the awful grayish tint fading. Around them, the other passengers were settling back into their seats, the crisis apparently over. The bus rumbled on.

"You feel better now?" Aunt Fareeda asked, searching her niece's face.

"Yes." Areeba managed a weak smile. "I'm fine. Really. Sorry for scaring everyone."

But Ayesha noticed the way her sister's hands trembled as she held the water bottle. And the way her eyes kept darting to the window, as if looking for something in the passing landscape.

---

Twenty minutes later, the incident had faded into family lore. Uncle Jamil was already retelling it with embellishments ("I thought we'd lost her!"), and the kids were giggling again in the back. Areeba insisted she felt fine, and gradually, the normalcy of the trip reasserted itself.

They played word games. They sang old film songs, slightly off-key. They argued good-naturedly about which hotel in Naran had the best breakfast. The mountains grew taller, more imposing, their peaks disappearing into low-hanging clouds.

Areeba even laughed at Uncle Jamil's terrible jokes, though Ayesha thought the laughter sounded forced, brittle at the edges.

When the bus finally pulled into a gas station, a squat concrete building with sun-faded signs advertising Pepsi and cigarettes, everyone groaned with relief.

"Finally!" Aunt Sadia gathered her purse. "I need to stretch my legs before they fall off."

"Toilet break!" one of the kids announced unnecessarily.

The driver killed the engine, and the sudden silence felt profound after hours of mechanical rumbling. Passengers shuffled toward the exit, joints cracking, backs aching. The air outside would be fresher, cleaner, tinged with pine and mountain cold.

Ayesha stood and stretched, her spine popping. Areeba rose beside her, moving carefully, as if testing her own stability.

"You sure you're okay?" Ayesha asked quietly.

"I told you, I'm fine." Areeba's tone had an edge to it. "Stop worrying."

They filed off the bus with the other women, Aunt Fareeda, Aunt Sadia, and a couple of family members. The men headed toward the small mosque adjacent to the gas station. The children scattered like birds, thrilled to be free from confinement.

The gas station sat at the edge of a valley, surrounded by rocky hills that would soon become proper mountains. The air was noticeably cooler here, crisp and thin. Ayesha inhaled deeply, grateful to fill her lungs with something other than recycled bus air.

"The toilets are around back," Aunt Sadia said, wrinkling her nose. "Hopefully they're not too terrible."

They walked as a group across the cracked concrete, their footsteps echoing. Somewhere, a radio played tinny music. The gas station attendant watched them with disinterested eyes while manually pumping fuel into the bus.

Areeba walked beside Ayesha, her sandals scuffing against the ground.

Three steps.

Four.

Five.

Ayesha heard it before she saw it, a sound like a sack of rice hitting concrete.

She turned.

Areeba was on the ground.

Not stumbling. Not kneeling. Fully collapsed, her body crumpled at an impossible angle, her head turned to the side, her eyes open but seeing nothing.

For a frozen moment, no one moved. The mountain wind whistled through the valley, cold and indifferent.

# CHAPTER 2: LALAZAR

Aunt Fareeda's scream shattered the mountain stillness.

"AREEBA!"

Ayesha's bag hit the ground as she lunged forward, dropping to her knees beside her sister's crumpled form. The concrete was rough and cold through her shalwar, tiny pebbles digging into her skin. Areeba lay motionless, her dupatta twisted around her neck, one arm bent beneath her at an angle that made Ayesha's stomach lurch.

"Not again!" Aunt Sadia's voice pitched high with panic. "Ya Allah, not again!"

"Get water! Someone get water!" Aunt Fareeda was already kneeling, her hands hovering over Areeba's face, shaking so badly she couldn't seem to touch her.

The other female cousins crowded around, creating a wall of bodies. Their shadows fell across Areeba's pale face, and somewhere beyond the circle, Ayesha could hear the children's laughter cutting off abruptly as word spread.

"What's happening?" Uncle Jamil's voice boomed across the gas station. Heavy footsteps thundered toward them. "Move! Let me through!"

Ayesha pressed her fingers against Areeba's wrist, searching for a pulse. Her own heart was hammering so hard she couldn't tell if the flutter she felt was Areeba's or her own blood rushing through her fingers.

"Is she breathing?" Aunt Fareeda demanded.

"I... I think so." Ayesha leaned closer. Yes. Shallow, but there. Areeba's chest rose and fell almost imperceptibly.

Uncle Jamil burst through the circle, Uncle Tariq right behind him. "What happened? Did she hit her head?"

"She just fell!" Ayesha said. "Just like before, she just... collapsed."

"This isn't normal," Uncle Tariq muttered, his face grim. "This isn't dehydration or car sickness. Something's wrong."

Water materialized, a bottle thrust into the circle by one of the male cousins. Aunt Fareeda grabbed it with trembling hands, twisting off the cap so frantically that water sloshed over the rim, splashing onto the concrete and darkening it in spreading splotches.

"Areeba! Beta, wake up!" She sprinkled water across Areeba's face. Droplets caught in her eyelashes, rolled down her temples. "Wake up!"

Nothing.

Ayesha's throat tightened. On the bus, Areeba had come around quickly. This was taking too long. Her sister's face had that same awful grayish tint, lips bloodless and slightly parted. One of her sandals had come off in the fall, and Ayesha found herself staring at it, lying there a few feet away, abandoned and pathetic.

"Areeba!" Uncle Jamil patted her cheek, gentle at first, then firmer. "Come on, beta. Open your eyes."

More water. Aunt Sadia was reciting prayers under her breath, the Arabic words tumbling out rapid-fire. Someone else had started crying, one of the younger cousins, probably.

Then...

A gasp.

Areeba's eyes flew open, wide and startled, her whole body jerking as if she'd been shocked. She sucked in air like she'd been drowning, her hands clawing at the concrete.

"She's awake! Alhamdulillah!" Aunt Fareeda clutched her chest.

Areeba blinked rapidly, her gaze unfocused and wild, darting from face to face without recognition. For a terrible moment, Ayesha thought she wasn't going to come back this time, that whoever was looking out through Areeba's eyes wasn't her sister at all.

But then Areeba's expression shifted, clarity filtering back in stages. "What... what happened?"

The relief was palpable. Uncle Jamil helped her sit up slowly, one hand supporting her back. "You fainted again, beta. Same as before."

"Again?" Areeba's voice was small, confused. Her hand went to her head, fingers trembling. "I don't... I don't remember..."

"That's it," Uncle Tariq said firmly. "We're taking you to a hospital. There must be one in Naran"

"No!" Areeba's response was sharp, immediate. "No, please. I'm fine. I just, maybe I stood up too fast. The altitude"

"Don't be stupid," Aunt Sadia snapped, fear making her harsh. "You can't keep fainting like this! What if something's seriously wrong?"

"Nothing's wrong!" Areeba tried to stand, wobbled, and Uncle Jamil caught her elbow. "I feel fine now. Really. Please, I don't want to ruin the trip for everyone."

Ayesha studied her sister's face. The color was returning, yes, but there was something else, a tightness around her eyes, a forced quality to her smile. Like she was performing normalcy rather than feeling it.

"We should at least rest," Uncle Jamil said. "How much farther to the hotel, driver?"

The bus driver had joined the crowd, his leathery face creased with concern. "Thirty minutes, sahib. Maybe forty with these roads."

"Then let's get her on the bus and go. She can lie down once we reach Lalazar."

They helped Areeba up, a forest of supporting hands. She moved gingerly, testing each step. Ayesha retrieved the fallen sandal and her own abandoned bag, her mind spinning. Twice in less than an hour. What were the odds of that being coincidence?

As they guided Areeba back to the bus, Ayesha caught her sister's eye. Areeba looked away quickly, but not before Ayesha saw it, a flicker of something that might have been fear.

---

The last leg of the journey passed in tense silence. The earlier excitement had evaporated, replaced by a watchful anxiety. Areeba sat wedged between Aunt Fareeda and the window, a human buffer against another collapse. Ayesha sat across the aisle, her eyes never leaving her sister for more than a few seconds.

Areeba stared out the window, her reflection ghostly against the passing mountains. She didn't speak. Didn't eat the biscuits Aunt Sadia offered. Just sat there, unnaturally still, while the bus climbed higher and higher into the Kaghan Valley.

The landscape transformed around them. The rocky hills gave way to proper mountains, their peaks sharp and snow-capped even in summer. Pine forests carpeted the slopes, dark and dense. The Kunhar River appeared beside the road, its glacial water a shocking turquoise against gray stone.

Beautiful. It should have been beautiful.

Instead, Ayesha felt a growing unease she couldn't name. Maybe it was the mountains themselves, too tall, too close, their shadows falling across the road like prison bars. Or maybe it was the way Areeba's lips were moving silently, forming words no one could hear.

When Ayesha blinked, her sister's lips were still. Had she imagined it?

Finally, the bus rounded a bend and Naran Bazar sprawled below them, a cluttered ribbon of hotels and shops wedged into the valley, the river rushing alongside it. Even in the off-season, the main bazaar buzzed with activity. Tour jeeps kicked up dust. Street vendors called out their wares. Tourists in colorful jackets browsed shops selling shawls and wooden crafts.

"There!" Uncle Jamil pointed. "Lalazar Hotel. See the sign?"

The bus navigated the narrow bazaar road with inches to spare, its horn blaring at pedestrians and donkeys alike. Lalazar Hotel stood three stories tall, its white paint chipped and faded but its sign freshly painted. A modest place, but clean, with window boxes full of marigolds and a small restaurant on the ground floor.

When the bus finally shuddered to a stop, the relief was universal.

"Alhamdulillah," Aunt Fareeda breathed.

They disembarked in a chaos of luggage and instructions. Uncle Jamil and Uncle Tariq handled check-in while everyone else milled about in the small lobby. The hotel smelled like pine wood and the lamb karahi cooking somewhere in the back. Ceiling fans spun lazily, barely disturbing the mountain air that drifted through open windows.

"Two rooms," Uncle Jamil announced, returning with keys. "Room 8 for the men, Room 9 for the ladies. Both on the second floor."

"No elevator?" Aunt Sadia eyed the narrow staircase dubiously.

"It's two floors, not twenty," Uncle Tariq said, already hefting a suitcase. "The exercise will do you good."

They divided the luggage. The men headed up first, their footsteps heavy on the wooden stairs. The women followed more slowly, burdened with bags and the day's accumulating exhaustion.

Ayesha climbed behind Areeba, ready to catch her if she stumbled. The staircase was dim, lit only by small windows at each landing. The wood creaked under their feet, and somewhere above, a door slammed.

Areeba climbed slowly, one hand on the railing, one hand clutching her small overnight bag. Her knuckles were white against the dark wood.

"Almost there," Aunt Fareeda encouraged from behind. "Just one more flight."

They reached the landing between floors. The window here looked out over the bazaar, late afternoon sun slanting through the glass. Areeba paused, silhouetted against the light.

"You okay, beta?" Aunt Sadia asked.

Areeba didn't answer. She swayed slightly, her bag slipping from her fingers.

"No..." Ayesha lunged forward.

But she was too late.

Areeba collapsed.

Not backward down the stairs, thank God, forward, onto the landing, her body hitting the wooden floor with a sickening thud. Her head bounced once, and then she was still.

"AREEBA!" Aunt Fareeda's scream echoed in the stairwell.

The men's footsteps thundered from above. Doors opened. Voices shouted. But Ayesha barely heard any of it. She was already on the ground, rolling Areeba onto her back, checking her airways, her pulse, her breathing.

Alive. Still alive.

"Not again, not again, not again." Aunt Sadia's mantra dissolved into sobs.

Uncle Jamil skidded onto the landing, nearly falling himself. "What... three times? THREE TIMES?"

"We need a doctor NOW!" Uncle Tariq was already pulling out his phone.

Ayesha cradled Areeba's head, protecting it from the hard floor. "Areeba, come on. Wake up. Please wake up."

Water appeared. They went through the ritual again, sprinkling, calling her name, patting her cheeks. But this time felt different. This time, Areeba's unconsciousness seemed deeper, more absolute. Her body was completely limp, boneless, and her skin had gone cold.

Too cold.

"She's freezing," Ayesha said. "Why is she so cold?"

Someone draped a shawl over Areeba. Someone else was crying. The hotel manager had appeared, wringing his hands and babbling about liability and doctors in the next valley.

"Wake up, beta, wake up, please wake up."

And then Areeba's eyes opened.

But something was wrong.

Ayesha knew it immediately, instinctively, in some primitive part of her brain that recognized predators and poison. Areeba's eyes were open, yes, but they were... empty. Not unfocused like before. Empty. Looking at nothing. Seeing nothing.

"Areeba?" Ayesha's voice came out as a whisper.

Areeba sat up.

The movement was wrong. Too smooth. Too controlled. Like a puppet on strings. No grogginess, no confusion, no gradual return to consciousness. One moment she was unconscious, the next she was upright, her spine straight, her head tilted at an odd angle.

"Beta?" Aunt Fareeda reached out hesitantly.

Areeba turned her head, too far, too fast, and looked at her aunt. But the expression on her face was completely blank. No recognition. No emotion. Nothing.

"Areeba, say something!" Uncle Jamil commanded.

Silence.

Areeba's mouth didn't move. She just sat there on the landing floor, surrounded by her panicked family, staring at them with eyes that held all the warmth of winter stones.

Ayesha's skin prickled. Every hair on her arms stood up. This wasn't her sister. This was something wearing her sister's face.

"Areeba?" Ayesha leaned closer, searching those empty eyes. "Can you hear me?"

Nothing. Not even a blink.

"She's in shock," Uncle Tariq said, but he didn't sound convinced. "Maybe she hit her head."

Areeba's hand moved.

Slowly, deliberately, she raised her right hand and stared at it, turning it this way and that, as if seeing a hand for the first time. Examining it. Learning it.

"What is she doing?" one of the younger cousins whimpered.

Ayesha's mouth had gone dry. She watched Areeba flex her fingers one by one, testing them, that same blank expression on her face. Then Areeba looked down at her own body, at her clothes, her legs, her feet, with that same detached curiosity.

Like someone trying on a new outfit.

Or a stranger inhabiting a borrowed body.

"This isn't right," Ayesha breathed. "Something's not..."

And then Areeba blinked.

Just once, but it broke the spell. Expression flooded back into her face, confusion, fear, disorientation. She looked around at the circle of frightened faces and her own eyes filled with tears.

"What..." Her voice cracked. "What happened? Why are you all." She noticed her raised hand, still suspended in the air, and lowered it quickly, staring at it like it had betrayed her. "Why am I on the floor?"

The relief was immediate but tentative. Aunt Fareeda pulled Areeba into a crushing embrace. "You fainted again, beta! You scared us to death!"

"I... I did?" Areeba's voice was small, confused. Normal. This was normal Areeba, frightened, disoriented, but herself. "I don't remember. I was climbing the stairs and then... nothing."

Ayesha studied her sister's face, looking for traces of that terrible emptiness. But Areeba's eyes were clear now, frightened but present. Had Ayesha imagined it? Had the stress and fear made her see things that weren't there?

But the cold feeling in her stomach remained.

"That's it," Uncle Jamil said firmly. "We're taking you to a doctor. Tonight. I don't care if we have to drive to Mansehra."

"No, please." Areeba tried to stand, wobbled, and three people grabbed her. "I'm okay now. Really. I just need to rest. Please don't make a fuss."

"A fuss?" Aunt Sadia's voice climbed an octave. "You've fainted three times! In one day! This isn't normal!"

"Maybe it's the altitude," the hotel manager offered weakly. "Some people react badly to the mountains. We have oxygen."

"She fainted in Lahore plains and on the highway before we even reached altitude," Uncle Tariq countered. "This is something else."

They argued over Areeba's head while Ayesha helped her sister to her feet. Areeba leaned heavily on her, legs shaking.

"Thanks," Areeba whispered.

"What happened?" Ayesha whispered back. "Just now, when you woke up. You weren't... you seemed..."

"I don't know what you're talking about." Areeba's voice was sharp, defensive. "I was unconscious and then I woke up. That's all."

"But you didn't say anything. You just sat there, staring."

"I was confused! I'd just fainted! What was I supposed to do, make jokes?" Areeba pulled away from her, swaying slightly but standing on her own. "Everyone needs to stop overreacting. I'm fine."

But her hands were shaking. And she wouldn't meet Ayesha's eyes.

Finally, a compromise was reached. Areeba would rest in the room. If she fainted againâ€”even onceâ€”they were taking her to a hospital, trip be damned. Reluctantly, the family dispersedâ€”the men to their room, the women continuing up the final flight of stairs with Areeba supported between them.

Room 9 was simple but cleanâ€”four single beds, white walls, thin curtains filtering mountain light. Areeba collapsed onto the nearest bed without even removing her shoes.

"Sleep, beta," Aunt Fareeda said, smoothing hair back from Areeba's forehead. "We'll be right here."

Areeba's eyes were already closing. Within minutes, her breathing had deepened into sleep.

Ayesha sat on the bed across from her, unable to look away. In sleep, Areeba looked peaceful. Young. Vulnerable.

Normal.

But Ayesha couldn't shake what she'd seen on the landing. That moment of absolute emptiness. The way Areeba had examined her own hand like it belonged to a stranger.

Like someone, or something had slipped into her skin.

Outside the window, the sun was setting behind the mountains, painting the peaks in shades of gold and blood. The Kunhar River rushed past below, its voice a constant whisper beneath the sounds of the bazaar.

Ayesha pulled out her phone. No signal, of course. The mountains blocked everything.

She looked at Areeba again, watched her chest rise and fall with each breath.

*What's happening to you?* she thought. *And why do I feel like this is only the beginning?*

# CHAPTER 3: SOMETHING BORROWED

Morning light crept through the thin curtains of Room 9, turning everything a pale, watery gold. Ayesha woke to the sound of the azaan echoing from the mosque down the street, the call to prayer mixing with the ever-present rush of the Kunhar River. For a blissful moment, she forgot about yesterday's terror.

Then she remembered.

She sat up quickly, her eyes going immediately to Areeba's bed.

Empty.

Panic seized her chest, but then she heard the toilet flush, and the bathroom door opened. Aunt Fareeda emerged, already dressed in a fresh shalwar kameez, her dupatta neatly pinned.

"Good morning," she said quietly, careful not to wake Aunt Sadia, who was still snoring softly in the bed by the window. "Sleep well?"

"How's Areeba?" Ayesha asked instead of answering.

Aunt Fareeda glanced at the fourth bed, where Areeba lay curled on her side, still deeply asleep. "She didn't wake once. Not even for Fajr. I checked her breathing twice." She lowered her voice even more. "Maybe she just needed rest. Yesterday was... stressful."

Stressful. That was one word for it.

Ayesha slipped out of bed, her joints stiff from yesterday's long bus ride. The wooden floor was cold against her bare feet. She gathered her clothes and toiletries and headed for the bathroom, trying to shake off the unease that had settled into her bones.

The shower was barely lukewarm, the water pressure weak, but Ayesha stood under it longer than necessary, letting it wash away yesterday's fear. By the time she emerged, dressed, hair damp and braided, face fresh, Aunt Sadia was awake and the room had filled with the quiet bustle of morning routines.

Areeba was still asleep.

"Should we wake her?" Aunt Sadia asked, applying moisturizer from a small jar. "The men want to leave for Saif-ul-Malook by nine."

"Let her rest a bit longer," Aunt Fareeda said. "After yesterday."

A sudden movement from Areeba's bed cut her off.

Areeba sat bolt upright, so abruptly it made all three women jump. Her hair was wild around her face, her dupatta tangled around her neck, her eyes wide and bright.

"Good morning!" she announced, her voice cheerful and loud in the quiet room.

Ayesha blinked. After three fainting spells and a night of what should have been fitful sleep, Areeba sounded like she'd just returned from a spa vacation. Energized. Almost manic.

"Beta," Aunt Fareeda said carefully, "how are you feeling?"

"Feeling?" Areeba stretched her arms above her head, arching her back like a cat. "Amazing! Absolutely amazing!" She looked down at herself, at her wrinkled clothes, her bare feet, and laughed. A strange, delighted laugh. "Wow... I'm still dressed. I slept in my clothes!" She ran her hands down her arms, her sides, as if rediscovering her own body. "This is... wow."

Ayesha exchanged a glance with her aunts. Aunt Sadia's expression was wary. Aunt Fareeda's smile was uncertain.

"Well," Aunt Fareeda said slowly, "I'm glad you're feeling better. We were very worried."

"Worried?" Areeba swung her legs off the bed and stood, swaying slightly before finding her balance. She walked to the small mirror mounted on the wall, her steps careful, deliberate. "Why worried?"

"You fainted," Aunt Sadia said flatly. "Three times. Yesterday. Do you remember?"

Areeba stared at her reflection, tilting her head one way, then the other. She touched her face, her cheeks, her nose, her lips, with the same exploratory curiosity a child might use. "Fainted," she repeated, but the word sounded empty of meaning. Then she smiled, a wide, bright smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. "But I'm fine now! Look at me!" She spread her arms. "Looking amazing, right?"

The phrasing was odd. Not "don't I look" or "I look" but "looking amazing" like she was narrating herself. Like she was trying out phrases she'd heard but didn't quite understand.

Ayesha felt that cold sensation return to her stomach.

"You look tired," she said carefully. "You should rest more."

"Rest?" Areeba laughed again, that same too-bright sound. "No, no, no. Today is for fun! Family trip, right?" She turned from the mirror and her eyes landed on Ayesha, and something in her expression shifted. Brightened. "Ayesha!"

Before Ayesha could react, Areeba crossed the room in three long strides and pulled her into a crushing embrace. Her arms wrapped around Ayesha's shoulders, squeezing tight, her face buried in Ayesha's neck.

"You smell amazing," Areeba breathed, her voice muffled against Ayesha's skin.

Ayesha went rigid. Areeba was touchy sometimes, they all were, it was normal for some families, but this felt wrong. Too tight. Too intense. Too familiar. Areeba was inhaling deeply, like she was memorizing Ayesha's scent.

"Okay, that's..." Ayesha pushed her away, forcing a laugh to cover her discomfort. "Okay, calm down. Go get ready. We're leaving soon."

Areeba stepped back, still smiling that strange smile. "Ready? Oh! Yes! Ready!" She looked around the room as if seeing it for the first time. Her small suitcase lay beside her bed, still closed. "Where... where are my clothes?"

"In your suitcase, obviously," Aunt Sadia said, her tone sharpening with concern. "Are you sure you're feeling alright?"

"Perfect! I told you, perfect!" Areeba knelt beside her suitcase and opened it, staring at the contents with visible confusion. She pulled out a purple kameez, examined it, put it back. Pulled out a pair of jeans, frowned at them, put them back. Like she was looking at artifacts from an alien culture.

Ayesha watched, her unease growing. Areeba was meticulous about her clothes. She'd spent twenty minutes last week showing Ayesha her planned outfits for this trip, coordinated down to the accessories.

"Do you need help?" Aunt Fareeda offered.

"No!" Areeba's response was sharp, defensive. Then she softened, that smile returning. "No, thank you. I can... I'll figure it out."

She grabbed clothes seemingly at random, a green kameez that clashed with orange embroidered pants, a purple dupatta, and disappeared into the bathroom.

The three women left in the room looked at each other.

"That was strange," Aunt Sadia said quietly.

"She's probably still disoriented," Aunt Fareeda said, but she didn't sound convinced. "Maybe the fainting... maybe it affected her somehow."

Ayesha said nothing. She was thinking about yesterday. About that moment on the landing when Areeba had examined her own hand like it belonged to a stranger.

From the bathroom came the sound of running water. Then humming, off-key and tuneless, like someone who'd never heard music trying to imitate it.

Ayesha had never heard Areeba hum like that.

Ten minutes passed. Fifteen. The men knocked on the door, were they ready? Almost, Aunt Fareeda called back. Just a few more minutes.

Finally, the bathroom door opened.

Areeba emerged and Ayesha's eyebrows shot up.

Her sister's outfit was a disaster, the clashing colors somehow even worse in combination, the dupatta draped crookedly over one shoulder. But it was her face that made Ayesha stare. Areeba wore no makeup. None. Not even the tinted lip balm she usually applied, or the kajal she never left the room without.

Her hair hung loose and uncombed, wild waves falling past her shoulders, still tangled from sleep.

"I'm ready!" Areeba announced proudly.

Aunt Sadia's mouth opened, then closed. Aunt Fareeda blinked rapidly.

Ayesha found her voice first. "At least tie your hair."

Areeba's hand went to her hair, running through the tangles. She looked confused. "Tie it?"

"Yes. You know. A ponytail? A braid? Something?" Ayesha gestured to her own neatly braided hair. "We're going to the lake. It'll be windy."

Areeba stared at her, then at Aunt Fareeda's carefully pinned dupatta, then at Aunt Sadia's neat bun. Understanding seemed to dawn, but it was followed immediately by something that looked almost like panic.

"I..." Areeba's voice dropped. "I don't know how to."

The room fell silent. Even the sounds from outside, the bazaar waking up, the river's rushâ€”seemed to fade.

"What?" Ayesha said.

"I don't know how to tie my hair." Areeba was still smiling, but there was a brittleness to it now. A crack in the performance. "Can you... can you show me?"

Aunt Sadia laughed, sharp and disbelieving. "Very funny, beta. Now seriously, fix yourself. We're late."

But Areeba wasn't laughing. She just stood there, hair wild, clothes mismatched, staring at them with an expression that was equal parts helpless and defiant.

"You don't know how to tie your hair," Ayesha repeated slowly. "You. The girl who spent two hours on YouTube learning a fishtail braid. The girl who literally taught me how to do a proper bun."

Something flickered across Areeba's face, fear, maybe, or confusion. "I... I forgot?"

"You forgot." The words fell flat.

"Maybe from the fainting," Aunt Fareeda said quickly, jumping in. "Head trauma can cause temporary memory issues. I saw it on a show once."

"I didn't hit my head that hard," Ayesha cut her off, her eyes never leaving Areeba. "Did you?"

"I don't remember!" Areeba's voice rose, taking on a desperate edge. "I don't remember hitting anything! I don't remember fainting! I don't." She stopped abruptly, her hands clenched into fists. Then, more quietly: "Please. Can someone just... help me?"

The vulnerability in that request should have softened Ayesha. Should have made her feel guilty for being suspicious. But instead, it sent ice down her spine. Because Areeba didn't sound like someone who'd temporarily forgotten a skill.

She sounded like someone who'd never known it in the first place.

"Come here," Ayesha said finally.

Areeba approached cautiously, almost shyly. Ayesha guided her to sit on the bed and stood behind her, gathering the dark waves of hair in her hands. It was coarse with dried sweat and yesterday's dust.

"When did you last wash your hair?" Ayesha asked.

"I... I don't..." Areeba trailed off.

Ayesha began braiding, her fingers working automatically through the familiar motions. French braid, tight and neat. Behind Areeba's head, safe from view, Ayesha let her expression show what she was feeling. Worry. Confusion. And something deeper. Something cold.

Because Areeba sat perfectly still, her posture straight, barely breathing. Like she'd never had her hair braided before. Like she didn't know this was something sisters did for each other all the time.

Like she didn't know who Ayesha was.

"There," Ayesha said, tying off the braid with an elastic from her wrist. "Done."

Areeba reached back, touching the braid with wonder. "It feels... strange."

"It's a braid, not a surgical procedure," Aunt Sadia muttered, gathering her purse. "Now can we please go? The men have knocked three times."

Areeba stood and went to the mirror again. She turned her head side to side, examining the braid like it was the most fascinating thing she'd ever seen. "You're very skilled," she said to Ayesha's reflection. "Thank you."

You're very skilled. Not "thanks, you're the best" or even just "thanks." Formal. Distant. Like thanking a stranger for directions.

Ayesha opened her mouth to respond, to say what, she didn't knowâ€”but another knock interrupted.

"LADIES!" Uncle Jamil's voice boomed through the door. "We're going to miss the entire morning!"

"Coming!" Aunt Fareeda called. She ushered everyone toward the door, grabbing bags and dupatta pins and water bottles. The small room erupted into organized chaos.

Ayesha hung back, watching Areeba. Her sister moved through the flurry with an odd carefulness, like she was navigating an obstacle course. She picked up a small purse, her own purse, which she'd carried yesterday, and stared at it for a long moment before slinging it over her shoulder.

Then she caught Ayesha watching and smiled. That same bright, empty smile.

"Today will be fun," Areeba said. Not a question. A statement. Like she was reading from a script.

"Yeah," Ayesha said quietly. "Fun."

But as they filed out of the room into the dim hallway, where the men were waiting with varying degrees of impatience, Ayesha made a decision.

She was going to watch Areeba. Closely. Every word, every movement, every strange moment.

Because whoever had woken up in that bed this morning...

Ayesha was becoming increasingly certain it wasn't her sister.

# Chapter 4 - Saif-ul-Muluk
---
The hallway was narrow, dimly lit by a single bulb that flickered intermittently. The wooden floorboards creaked under their feet as the women emerged from Room 9. Uncle Jamil stood with his arms crossed, Uncle Tariq beside him checking his watch. The male cousins, Faizan, Hamza, and Bilalâ€”lounged against the wall, scrolling through their phones even though there was barely any signal.

"Finally!" Uncle Jamil said. "We were about to send a search party."

"Sorry, sorry," Aunt Fareeda said, adjusting her dupatta. "Someone took forever getting ready."

Areeba stepped out last, and Ayesha watchedâ€”really watchedâ€”as her cousin's entire demeanor shifted.

Her shoulders straightened. Her stride changed. Instead of the small, careful steps women took in shalwar kameez, Areeba walked with a longer gait, her hips straight instead of swaying, her arms swinging loose at her sides. Confident. Almost swaggering.

Like a boy.

"Hey, bro!" Areeba called out, her voice loud and cheerful as she approached the male cousins.

Everyone froze.

Faizan looked up from his phone, his eyebrows shooting toward his hairline. "Uh... good morning to you too?"

"Areeba," Aunt Sadia hissed. "What are you."

But Areeba was already striding toward Hamza, her hand extended. Not in a delicate handshake, but palm up, fingers spreadâ€”ready for a high-five or a handshake that would involve gripping, not just touching.

Hamza stared at her hand like it might bite him.

"You... want to shake hands?" he asked uncertainly.

"Yeah! Yeah, let's go!" Areeba grabbed his hand and shook it vigorously, pumping it up and down with an enthusiasm that made Hamza stumble backward. "Ready for today? Going to be awesome, right?"

"I... sure?" Hamza extracted his hand, glancing at his brothers with a look that clearly said *is she okay?*

Bilal, the youngest at sixteen, couldn't hide his smirk. "Someone's in a weird mood."

"Weird? This is not weird!" Areeba clapped him on the shoulderâ€”hardâ€”and Bilal actually winced. "This is excited! Come on, bro, lighten up!"

"Bro," Bilal repeated, his smirk widening. "Did Areeba just call me bro?"

"Maybe she hit her head harder than we thought," Faizan muttered.

Uncle Jamil cleared his throat. "Well. Shall we go then? The jeeps are waiting."

They made their way down the stairsâ€”narrow and steep, the wood worn smooth by years of footsteps. Areeba took them two at a time, her dupatta sliding off her shoulder and dragging behind her like a forgotten accessory. Aunt Fareeda scrambled to keep up.

"Slow down, beta! You'll trip!"

But Areeba didn't slow down. She practically bounded down the stairs, hit the landing, spun around the banister post, and continued down the next flight with the energy of an overexcited puppy.

Ayesha descended more carefully, watching her cousin's every move. The way Areeba held herself. The way she moved through space. It was all wrong. Areeba had always been graceful, conscious of her movements in the way women learned to beâ€”keeping her dupatta in place, watching where she stepped, moving through the world aware of the space her body occupied.

This Areeba moved like she'd never worn women's clothes before. Like she didn't know she was supposed to.

They emerged into the hotel's small lobby. Morning sunlight streamed through the windows, illuminating dust motes that danced in the air. The smell of chai and parathas wafted from the restaurant, mixing with the crisp mountain air coming through the open door.

Two jeeps waited outsideâ€”battered Toyota Land Cruisers with faded green paint and tires caked in mountain mud. The drivers stood beside them, both lean men in their forties with weathered faces and traditional pakol caps.

Areeba walked straight up to the nearest driver.

"Hey, man!" she said, and before Ayesha could process what was happening, Areeba extended her fist.

The driver stared at it.

"Uh..." he said.

Areeba bounced her fist up and down encouragingly. "Come on! Fist bump!"

Slowly, looking utterly confused, the driver raised his own fist and bumped it against Areeba's. She pulled back and made an exploding gesture with her fingers, complete with sound effects.

"Boom! Yeah! Going to be a great day, right?"

The driver looked at Uncle Jamil. Uncle Jamil looked at Aunt Fareeda. Aunt Fareeda looked at the sky, probably praying for patience.

"She's... feeling better," Uncle Jamil said weakly. "From yesterday."

"This is better?" Aunt Sadia whispered to Ayesha. "This?"

Ayesha didn't answer. She was watching Areeba, who had moved on to inspecting the jeep with intense interest, running her hands along the hood, peering at the tires, even kicking one experimentally.

"Nice ride," Areeba announced. "Very rugged. I like it."

"You like it," Faizan repeated, his tone flat. "You. Who cried when we went off-roading last year because you were worried about your makeup."

Areeba looked at him blankly. "Did I?"

"You literally made us stop so you could fix your lipstick."

"Huh." Areeba shrugged, a loose, one-shouldered gesture. "Well, I'm different now."

"You can say that again," Bilal muttered.

"Okay, everyone in!" Uncle Jamil called, clearly eager to move past this weirdness. "Same groups as we planned. Ladies and kids in jeep one, men in jeep two. Let's go!"

The family began sorting themselves out. Ayesha ended up climbing into the first jeep, choosing a seat by the window. Aunt Fareeda settled in beside her, with Aunt Sadia taking the front passenger seat. The two younger kidsâ€”Hiba and little Zaynâ€”squeezed into the back row.

That left one seat. Next to Ayesha.

Areeba hauled herself into the jeep with zero grace, nearly kicking Hiba in the process. She dropped into the seat beside Ayesha, her legs spread wide, taking up more than her fair share of space. Her dupatta had slipped entirely off her head and lay bunched around her shoulders like a forgotten scarf.

"This is great!" Areeba declared. "Adventure time!"

The driver climbed into his seat, started the engine with a roar, and they lurched forward. The second jeep followed close behind, its horn beeping cheerfully.

They navigated through Naran Bazaarâ€”still waking up, shopkeepers rolling up metal shutters, street vendors setting up their carts of corn and chai. Tourists were already emerging, cameras in hand, ready to capture the mountain magic.

The jeep turned onto the road leading up to Saif-ul-Malook, and immediately the smooth pavement gave way to rough gravel and dirt. The vehicle bounced and jolted, throwing everyone around.

"Sorry, sorry!" the driver called back. "Road is very bad this season!"

Aunt Sadia gripped the handle above her door, her knuckles white. Hiba and Zayn squealed with a mix of terror and delight at each particularly violent bump.

And Areeba laughed.

That same loud, uninhibited laugh from this morning. She braced her hands against the seat in front of her and the roof, absorbing the shocks like she was on a carnival ride, grinning from ear to ear.

"This is amazing!" she shouted over the engine noise. "Look at this view!"

Ayesha had to admit, the view was stunning. The road climbed steeply, switchback after switchback, and with each turn the valley opened up below themâ€”the Kunhar River a silver thread far below, Naran Bazar shrinking to toy-town proportions, the mountains rising in layers of green and gray and white.

But she couldn't enjoy it. Not while Areeba sat beside her, legs still spread like a man's, one arm hanging out the window like she was in some American road trip movie, completely unselfconscious in a way the real Areeba had never been.

"Are you feeling okay?" Ayesha asked quietly, leaning close so only Areeba could hear.

Areeba turned to her, that bright smile still plastered on her face. "Why does everyone keep asking that? I feel great! Best I've ever felt!"

"It's just... you're acting different."

"Different how?"

Ayesha gestured vaguely at... all of her. "Just different."

"Well, maybe yesterday changed me," Areeba said, and for just a moment, something flickered in her eyes. Something that wasn't quite human. "Maybe I'm seeing things more clearly now."

Before Ayesha could respond, the jeep hit a massive pothole and everyone went airborne for a second before crashing back down. Zayn yelped. Aunt Fareeda gasped. Aunt Sadia started praying audibly.

And Areeba whooped like she was on a rollercoaster.

"Again!" she shouted to the driver. "Do that again!"

"There will be many more, I promise!" the driver called back, grinning despite himself.

They climbed higher. The pine forests grew denser, the air colder and thinner. Ayesha could feel it in her lungsâ€”each breath taking slightly more effort. Aunt Fareeda pulled out a shawl and wrapped it around her shoulders. Hiba complained that her ears hurt.

"That's the altitude," the driver explained. "We're at 10,000 feet now. The lake is at 10,500. Yawn and it will help with the pressure."

Everyone dutifully yawned, their ears popping. Everyone except Areeba, who continued to stare out the window with rapt attention, seemingly unaffected by the altitude change.

An hour into the journey, they stopped at a small viewpoint where both jeeps could pull over. Everyone needed to stretch, use the makeshift bathroom facilities (a terrifying wooden structure perched over a cliff), and give their bodies a break from the constant jostling.

Ayesha climbed out of the jeep on shaky legs, her back aching and her head starting to pound from the altitude. Around her, the family emerged looking similarly battered. Aunt Sadia immediately sat on a rock, fanning herself. Uncle Jamil grimaced as he stretched his back. The male cousins looked pale and slightly green.

"I hate mountain roads," Hamza groaned. "I think I'm going to be sick."

"Don't you dare," Faizan said. "We still have the ride back."

And then there was Areeba.

She jumped out of the jeep like she'd been sitting in an air-conditioned room, not a rattling metal box on a road designed by sadists. Her eyes were bright, her color good, her movements energetic.

"Come on, everyone!" She gestured to the viewpoint overlook. "Let's go check out the view! It's incredible!"

"How are you so energetic?" Bilal demanded. "You fainted three times yesterday!"

"I feel great!" Areeba joggedâ€”actually joggedâ€”toward the overlook.

Ayesha watched her go, a frown deepening on her face. She felt like she'd been put through a blender. How was Areeba fine?

They spent fifteen minutes at the viewpoint, taking photos and letting their bodies recover before the final leg to the lake. By the time they piled back into the jeeps, Ayesha's headache had bloomed into a full migraine, courtesy of the altitude.

Aunt Fareeda offered her some pills. "For the headache. The altitude affects everyone differently."

But as Ayesha swallowed the pills with water from a plastic bottle, she looked at Areebaâ€”completely unaffected, practically vibrating with energyâ€”and wondered.

If altitude affected everyone differently, why didn't it affect Areeba at all?

---

Saif-ul-Malook Lake appeared suddenly, like a jewel revealed when a curtain is pulled back.

One moment they were navigating yet another tight switchback through pine trees, and the nextâ€”there it was. A vast expanse of glacial water, impossibly blue-green, ringed by snow-capped peaks that seemed to scrape the sky. The lake's surface was mirror-still, reflecting the mountains and clouds with perfect clarity.

"Subhanallah," Aunt Fareeda breathed.

Even through her headache, Ayesha had to admit it was breathtaking. The lake looked like something from a fairy taleâ€”which, she supposed, it was. The legend of Prince Saif-ul-Malook and the fairy princess Badri-ul-Jamala was famous throughout Pakistan. This lake was where their love story had supposedly unfolded.

The jeeps parked in the designated area, a flat expanse of dirt where dozens of other vehicles satâ€”more jeeps, a few adventurous cars, even some motorcycles. Tourists milled about, bundled in jackets despite it being summer. The altitude made everything colder.

"Okay, everyone out!" Uncle Jamil announced. "We have two hours here. Take photos, enjoy the lake, but stay together. And nobody goes in the waterâ€”it's glacial, you'll freeze."

They disembarked, and immediately Ayesha felt the difference in the air. Thinner, colder, crisp in a way that made her lungs work harder. At over 10,500 feet, every movement took effort.

Around her, the family felt it too. The male cousins moved slowly, breathing deliberately. Aunt Sadia sat on a nearby rock almost immediately, waving off offers of help. The younger kids were energetic at first, but their movements were sluggish, uncoordinated.

"Take it easy," Uncle Tariq warned. "The altitude can make you dizzy."

And then there was Areeba.

She strode toward the lake like she was taking a walk in the park. Long steps, arms swinging, breathing normally. When she reached the rocky shore, she bent down and picked up a flat stone, examining it with interest.

"Come on!" she called back. "Let's walk around the lake!"

"Walk around it?" Aunt Fareeda looked horrified. "Beta, it's enormous! And we're all tired!"

"You guys are tired? Already?" Areeba shook her head, looking genuinely confused. "But we just got here!"

Ayesha trudged toward her cousin, each step requiring conscious effort. The headache pounded behind her eyes, and she felt vaguely nauseous. When she finally reached Areeba, she had to stop and catch her breath.

"You're not... tired?" Ayesha managed.

"No. Should I be?"

"Areeba, we're at over 10,000 feet. The air is literally thinner. Most people feel it."

Areeba looked at the mountains, then at the lake, then at Ayesha. Something like understanding crossed her face. "Oh. Right. The altitude thing. I forgot." She paused. "I mean, I don't feel it, but I guess I should?"

"You don't feel it," Ayesha repeated slowly.

"Is that weird?"

"Yes, Areeba. That's weird. You fainted three times yesterday from apparently nothing, and today you're running around at high altitude like it's nothing."

Areeba's expression clouded. That bright smile faltered. "I told you, I feel fine now. Better than fine. I feel..." She trailed off, searching for words. "Strong. Clear. Like I could do anything."

Before Ayesha could respond, Areeba suddenly bent down and in one smooth motion, scooped Ayesha up into her arms.

"Whatâ€”HEY!" Ayesha yelped, grabbing onto Areeba's shoulders for balance. "Put me down!"

But Areeba was already walking, carrying Ayesha like she weighed nothing, heading toward a cluster of rocks near the lake's edge. She wasn't even breathing hard.

"See? I'm strong now!" Areeba said cheerfully. "I can carry you no problem!"

"AREEBA!"

"What's happening?" Aunt Fareeda's alarmed voice came from behind them.

"Why is Areeba carrying Ayesha?" Bilal asked, sounding equal parts confused and amused.

"Put her down!" Uncle Jamil's voice boomed. "What are you doing?"

Areeba finally set Ayesha down on a flat rock, carefully, almost gently. But Ayesha's heart was racing, and not from the sudden movement.

Because Areeba had just carried her. A grown woman. At over 10,000 feet elevation. Without breaking a sweat.

Without even breathing hard.

Areeba herself was a slender twenty-two-year-old who'd never worked out a day in her life. Who used to complain about carrying grocery bags from the car to the house.

This was impossible.

"How did you..." Ayesha stared at her cousin. "How did you just do that?"

Areeba looked down at her own arms, flexing them experimentally. "I don't know. I just... did. I wanted to show you I'm fine, so I picked you up. Was that wrong?"

"You carried a full-grown person like she was a bag of flour!" Faizan said, having jogged over with the others. He was breathing hard from the exertion. "How?"

"I guess I'm stronger than I thought?" Areeba offered, but she sounded uncertain now, like she was realizing her mistake.

Uncle Tariq's expression had gone serious. "Beta, that's not normal. Maybe we really should take you to a doctor."

"No!" Areeba's response was sharp, almost panicked. "No doctors. I'm fine. I just... I've been feeling really good today. Is that a crime?"

"It's not normal," Aunt Sadia said, her voice quiet but firm. "Nothing about your behavior today has been normal."

Areeba's jaw tightened. For a moment, that blank expression from the hotel staircase returnedâ€”empty, cold. Then she forced a smile. "I'm just excited to be here. That's all. I got carried away. Sorry."

But as the family slowly dispersedâ€”some to take photos, others to rest, Uncle Jamil and Uncle Tariq talking in low, concerned voicesâ€”Ayesha stayed on her rock, watching Areeba.

Her cousin had wandered to the water's edge and stood there, staring out at the lake with an intensity that seemed wrong. Her lips were moving again, forming silent words. Her hands hung at her sides, fingers twitching.

And she wasn't shivering.

Everyone else was bundled in shawls and jackets, breath misting in the cold mountain air. But Areeba stood in just her thin kameez and that forgotten dupatta, completely unbothered by the temperature.

Like she didn't feel the cold.

Like she didn't feel anything.

Ayesha wrapped her arms around herself, suddenly chilled in a way that had nothing to do with altitude or weather. She thought about yesterday. About the fainting. About the way Areeba had examined her own hand like it was foreign to her.

About the way she'd woken up this morningâ€”cheerful, energetic, wrong.

About the way she'd needed to be taught to braid her own hair.

About the way she greeted male cousins like a boy would.

About the way she'd just carried Ayesha without effort.

All the pieces were there, scattered like stones around the lake. Ayesha just couldn'tâ€”or didn't want toâ€”put them together yet.

Because if she did, she'd have to accept something impossible.

Something terrifying.

That whoeverâ€”or whateverâ€”was standing at the lake's edge, wearing her cousin's face and body...

Wasn't Areeba at all.

# CHAPTER 5: THE CONFRONTATION

The two hours at Saif-ul-Malook passed in a blur of photographs and forced normalcy. The family posed against the backdrop of impossible blue water and snow-capped peaks, smiling for cameras while Ayesha watched Areeba from the corner of her eye.

Her sister remained unnaturally energetic, bounding from rock to rock, picking up stones and examining them with childlike fascination, asking questions about everythingâ€”"What kind of fish live here?" "Why is the water this color?" "What are those birds called?"â€”like a tourist in her own body.

Uncle Jamil checked his watch. "Okay, everyone! Time to head back. We want to reach Naran before dark."

A collective groan rose from the group. The thought of another hour-long jeep ride on those brutal roads made everyone's bodies ache preemptively. Aunt Sadia looked like she might cry. The male cousins moved with the stiff gait of people whose muscles had already staged a rebellion.

But Areeba practically skipped toward the parked jeeps.

"That was amazing! Can we come back tomorrow?" she called over her shoulder.

No one answered. They were too busy trudging after her, breaths misting in the thin air, legs heavy with exhaustion and altitude sickness.

Ayesha hung back, letting the others pass. Her headache had subsided to a dull throb, but her unease had only grown. She watched Areeba reach the jeeps and pause, looking around as if trying to remember which one she'd arrived in.

Like she didn't know.

The family began sorting themselves out, the same groups as before. Ayesha started toward the first jeep, where Aunt Fareeda was already climbing in, when she noticed something.

Areeba had stopped moving.

She stood beside the jeep, one hand on the door handle, her body suddenly rigid. And thenâ€”

She jerked.

A violent, full-body spasm, like she'd been shocked. Her head snapped to the side, her shoulders twisted, her free hand clawed at the air. For a brief, terrible moment, her face contortedâ€”features pulling in different directions, expression cycling through confusion, fear, rage, and something else. Something pleading.

It lasted maybe two seconds.

Then Areeba's handâ€”the one clawing at airâ€”came down hard across her own face.

The slap echoed across the parking area, sharp and vicious. Her head rocked to the side from the impact.

Ayesha froze, her breath catching.

Areeba stumbled, caught herself against the jeep, and when she straightened, her face was smooth again. Calm. That same bright smile sliding back into place like a mask being repositioned.

Ayesha's heart hammered against her ribs. She looked aroundâ€”had anyone else seen that? But the family was occupied with settling into vehicles, arranging bags, helping the children. No one was looking at Areeba.

No one but Ayesha.

Their eyes met across the dusty parking area. For just a moment, Areeba's smile faltered. Her eyes widenedâ€”not with that false brightness, but with something real. Something terrified.

Then it was gone.

Ayesha's legs moved before her brain caught up. She crossed the distance between them in long strides, her exhaustion forgotten, her headache meaningless. Something had just happened. Something wrong. And she was done pretending she hadn't seen it.

"Ayesha!" Aunt Fareeda called from inside the jeep. "Come on, we're leaving!"

"One minute!" Ayesha called back, not taking her eyes off Areeba.

Her cousin watched her approach with an expression that was hard to read. Wariness? Fear? Curiosity?

When Ayesha was close enough, she didn't hesitate. She grabbed Areeba's shoulders and pushed her back against the jeep, hard enough that Areeba's back hit the metal with a dull thud. Hard enough to be serious.

"Heyâ€”" Areeba started.

"I know," Ayesha said, her voice low and fierce. She kept her body positioned to block them from the others' view. "I know you're not Areeba."

The words hung in the cold mountain air.

Areeba's eyes went wide. For a heartbeat, two heartbeats, she just stared at Ayesha. And in that stare, Ayesha saw the mask crack. Saw something beneath itâ€”something ancient and vast and utterly inhumanâ€”looking back at her.

Then Areeba's face twisted.

Her mouth opened, trembling. Her eyes filled with tearsâ€”real tears, spilling down her cheeks. Her hands came up to grip Ayesha's arms, fingers digging in with desperate strength.

"Ayeshaâ€”" The voice was Areeba's. Exactly Areeba's. Shaking and frightened and confused. "Ayesha, what's happening to me?"

Ayesha's grip loosened. "Areeba?"

"I don'tâ€”I can'tâ€”" Areeba's whole body was trembling now. The tears came faster. "I keep losing time. I'll be doing something and then suddenly I'm somewhere else and I don't rememberâ€”I don't rememberâ€”" Her voice broke. "Help me. Please. Something's wrong. Something's insideâ€”"

Her eyes cleared for just a moment. Focused. And in them, Ayesha saw her sister. The real Areeba. Terrified and trapped and fighting.

"Oh my God," Ayesha breathed. "You're still in thereâ€”"

Areeba's hand shot up and slapped herself again.

The crack was loud. Violent. Areeba's head snapped to the side and when it came back, her expression had changed completely. The tears were still there, but the eyes were different. Cold. Calculating.

And then they filled with a different kind of tearsâ€”performative ones. The face crumpled in exaggerated distress.

"Why are you hurting me?" The voice was higher now, younger, victimized. Areeba's hands pushed weakly at Ayesha's chest. "Ayesha, please! You're scaring me! Why are you being like this?"

"No," Ayesha hissed. "No, I just sawâ€”you justâ€”"

"Please stop!" Areeba's voice rose, loud enough to carry. "You're hurting me!"

"I'm notâ€”"

"AYESHA!" Aunt Fareeda's sharp voice cut through everything.

Ayesha's head whipped around. Her aunt had climbed out of the jeep and was striding toward them, her face a thundercloud of anger and concern. Uncle Tariq was looking over from the other jeep, his expression confused.

"What is going on here?" Aunt Fareeda demanded, reaching them in seconds. She grabbed Ayesha's arm and pulled her away from Areeba. "What are you doing?"

"I wasn'tâ€”she's notâ€”" Ayesha struggled to find words that wouldn't sound insane.

Areeba had pressed herself back against the jeep, one hand to her reddened cheekâ€”the one she'd slapped herself, Ayesha thought wildlyâ€”her eyes wide and brimming with tears. The picture of a victim.

"She just grabbed me," Areeba said, her voice small and hurt. "I don't know why. I was just standing here and she pushed me against the jeep and started saying weird thingsâ€”"

"I did notâ€”"

"Ayesha!" Aunt Fareeda's voice was sharp with disappointment. "She's your sister! What's gotten into you?"

"She's notâ€”" Ayesha started, but how could she finish that sentence? She's not my sister? She's not herself? She's not human?

"I know she's been acting strange," Aunt Fareeda continued, her voice softening slightly, "and I know you're worried. We all are. But you can't just attack herâ€”"

"I didn't attack her! I was trying toâ€”" What? Help? Confront whatever was wearing her sister's skin? "Something's wrong with her!"

"Yes, obviously something is wrong! She fainted three times yesterday! But manhandling her isn't going to help!"

Areeba sniffled, wiping at her eyes. When she lowered her hand, she was looking at Ayesha with an expression of such perfect hurt and confusion that for a moment, Ayesha doubted herself.

Had she imagined the jerking? The self-slapping? The moment when Areeba's eyes had been clear and terrified and real?

"I'm sorry," Areeba said softly. "I don't know what I did to upset you. I was just trying to have fun today. After yesterday, I thought..." She trailed off, lower lip trembling. "I thought you'd be happy I was feeling better."

The performance was perfect. Too perfect.

"Is everything okay?" Uncle Tariq had approached, his brow furrowed with concern. "We heard shouting."

"Everything's fine," Areeba said quickly, pushing off from the jeep. She even managed a weak smile. "We were just playing around. You know how we are." She looked at Ayesha, and for just a fraction of a second, something cruel flickered in her eyes. Something masculine. Something that enjoyed this. "Right, Ayesha? Just playing?"

The words were a challenge. A dare. Say otherwise. Tell them what you think you saw. See if they believe you.

Ayesha's jaw clenched. Her hands curled into fists at her sides. Every instinct screamed at her to tell them, to make them seeâ€”but what had she actually seen? Her sister jerking, slapping herself, and now standing here with red cheeks that looked exactly like someone else had hit her.

He'd done it on purpose, she realized with cold clarity. Slapped Areeba's face hard enough to leave marks. To make it look like Ayesha had struck her.

There was no proof. Nothing concrete. Just Ayesha's word against the evidence of those red cheeks and Areeba's wounded expression.

"Right," Ayesha heard herself say, the word bitter in her mouth. "Just playing."

Aunt Fareeda didn't look convinced, but her eyes kept going to Areeba's reddened cheek. The doubt was clear on her faceâ€”doubt about Ayesha. "Well, play later. We need to leave. It'll be dark soon." She turned to Areeba, her expression softening with concern. "Are you okay, beta? Your cheek is very red. Does it hurt?"

Areeba touched it gingerly, wincing slightly. "I'm fine. It doesn't hurt much."

She didn't offer an explanation. Didn't need to. The implication hung in the airâ€”Ayesha had done this. Ayesha had hurt her.

Uncle Tariq's expression had cooled when he looked at Ayesha. "Let's just get back to the hotel. Everyone's tired and on edge."

They loaded into the jeeps in uncomfortable silence. The same configuration as beforeâ€”Ayesha and Areeba in the same vehicle, separated by mere inches of seat. But the space between them felt vast. Unbridgeable.

As the jeep started and began its descent down the mountain road, Ayesha stared out the window, her mind racing. She replayed the moment over and over. The jerking. The self-inflicted slap. The way Areeba's eyes had cleared and she'd begged for help before that thing took control again.

She's still in there, Ayesha thought. Trapped. Fighting. And now everyone thinks I'm the one hurting her.

"You okay?" Areeba's voice came from beside her, soft and concerned. But there was an undertone to it. Something mocking.

Ayesha didn't look at her. "Fine."

"You seem upset."

"I'm tired."

"Your aunt keeps looking back at us." A pause. "I think she's worried you might hurt me again."

Ayesha's hands clenched in her lap. He was enjoying this. Twisting the knife.

"I didn't hurt you," she said quietly, still not looking over.

"Didn't you?" The voice was still Areeba's, but the tone was wrong. Too confident. Too amused. "That's not what my face says. That's not what they all think."

Ayesha finally turned to look at her. Areeba's expression was serene, almost peaceful. But her eyesâ€”her eyes held something cold and calculating. Something that definitely wasn't female. The way he looked at her, assessed her, was too direct. Too aggressive.

"What are you?" Ayesha whispered.

Areeba smiled. Just slightly. Just enough. "Careful," he said, his voice barely audible under the jeep's engine noise. "You're already on thin ice. Keep asking questions like that and they'll think you've lost your mind."

Then Areeba turned away, looking out her own window, and the conversation was over.

The rest of the descent passed in tense silence. Ayesha noticed Aunt Fareeda glancing back at them several times, her expression troubled. Once, their eyes met, and Ayesha saw the question thereâ€”*Are you okay? What's going on with you?*

But how could she answer? How could she explain?

By the time they reached Naran Bazar, the sun was sinking behind the mountains, painting everything in shades of orange and purple. The temperature had dropped noticeably. Tourists crowded the streets, heading to restaurants for dinner, bundled in shawls and jackets.

The jeeps pulled up to Lalazar Hotel just as the streetlights flickered on. Everyone climbed out stiffly, groaning about sore backs and aching muscles. Even the children were subdued, worn out from the day.

"Dinner in one hour," Uncle Jamil announced. "Everyone freshen up. We'll eat downstairs in the restaurant."

They trudged into the hotel lobby. The same ceiling fans. The same smell of cooking meat and pine wood. The same creaky wooden stairs leading up to their rooms.

As they climbedâ€”slowly this time, everyone exhaustedâ€”Ayesha stayed close to Areeba, but not too close. Aunt Fareeda had positioned herself between them, whether consciously or unconsciously, Ayesha wasn't sure.

When they reached the landing where Areeba had fainted yesterday, she paused and looked down at the floor.

"This is where it happened, right?" she asked. "Where I fainted the third time?"

"Yes," Aunt Fareeda said, her voice careful.

Areeba stared at the spot for a long moment. "I don't remember it at all." She looked up at them with such perfect, wounded innocence. "That must have been scary for you all. I'm sorry."

"Don't apologize, beta," Aunt Sadia said tiredly. "Just... try not to do it again."

"I'll try my best," Areeba said, and Ayesha heard the mockery underneath. The performance.

They continued to the second floor. The men split off to Room 7, the women to Room 9. Inside, everyone collapsed onto beds with grateful sighs.

"I'm never going anywhere that requires jeeps again," Aunt Sadia announced, pressing her hands to her lower back. "My spine has relocated to somewhere near my brain."

Aunt Fareeda hummed in agreement, kicking off her shoes. "I'm going to shower first if no one minds. I feel like I'm covered in dust."

"Go ahead," Aunt Sadia said, already pulling out her phone charger even though there was no signal.

As Aunt Fareeda gathered her things and disappeared into the bathroom, the room settled into quiet. Aunt Sadia closed her eyes, resting. The younger cousins had gone to the men's room to play with their brothers.

Which left Ayesha and Areeba.

Ayesha sat on her bed, pulling out a book from her bag, trying to look occupied. She could feel Areeba watching her from across the room.

Minutes passed. The sound of the shower ran in the background. Aunt Sadia's breathing had deepenedâ€”not quite asleep, but close.

"You're very quiet," Areeba said suddenly, her voice low.

Ayesha didn't look up from her book. "I'm reading."

"No, you're not. Your eyes haven't moved across the page once."

Ayesha's grip tightened on the book.

She heard movementâ€”the creak of bedsprings, footsteps on the wooden floor. Then Areeba was standing beside her bed, looking down at her.

"We should talk," Areeba said quietly.

"There's nothing to talk about."

"I think there is." Areeba glanced at Aunt Sadiaâ€”still resting, eyes closed. Then she sat down on Ayesha's bed, close enough that their knees almost touched. "You're a problem."

Ayesha's eyes snapped up. Areeba's face was calm, almost friendly. But the eyes were all wrong. Hard. Male. Assessing.

"I don't know what you think you saw," he continued in Areeba's voice, "but you need to let it go."

"Give her back," Ayesha whispered fiercely. "Whatever you are, get out of her body."

Areeba smiledâ€”a slow, cold smile that Areeba's face had never made before. "I don't think so. I'm quite comfortable here."

"She was fighting you. I saw her. She's still in thereâ€”"

"Oh, she is," he said, and there was something cruel in his tone. "Areeba is fine. She'll be back. In factâ€”" he tilted his head, as if listening to something internal, "â€”we're going to share this body. An arrangement, you might say. She gets some time, I get some time. Fair, don't you think?"

Ayesha felt ice spread through her chest. "That's not fair. That's notâ€”this is her body. Her life."

"And now it's mine too." He leaned closer, and Ayesha instinctively leaned back. "Here's what's going to happen. You're going to keep your mouth shut. You're not going to tell anyone about our little... situation. Because if you doâ€”" his smile widened, "â€”who do you think they'll believe? The girl who's been acting a bit strange after fainting, or the girl who attacked her sister and left bruises on her face?"

"I didn'tâ€”"

"But that's what it looks like, isn't it?" He touched Areeba's reddened cheek. "Evidence. And if you start talking about possession or spirits or whatever explanation your little mind comes up with, well..." He shrugged. "They'll think you're crazy. Might even send you home early. Away from the family. Away from... Areeba."

The threat was clear. Speak up, and he'd make sure Ayesha was isolated, discredited, removed from the situation entirely.

"Why are you doing this?" Ayesha asked, hating how her voice shook. "Why her? Why any of this?"

"Why?" He seemed to consider the question. "Because I can. Because I was there, and she was... available. Because thisâ€”" he gestured at Areeba's body, "â€”is better than where I was." His expression darkened. "You have no idea what it's like. No form. No substance. No way to touch, to feel, to experience. And then she came along, walking right through the threshold, practically inviting me in."

"The bus," Ayesha breathed. "When she first fainted. That's when youâ€”"

"Smart girl." He stood up, looking down at her with something like amusement. "So here's the deal. You keep quiet. You play along. You let me have my time in this body, and Areeba gets to share it. She'll come back sometimes. You might even get to talk to her. But if you interfereâ€”" his voice dropped, took on a harder edge, "â€”I can make Areeba disappear completely. I can push her down so deep she'll never surface again. Do you understand?"

Ayesha stared at him, horror and rage warring in her chest. "You can'tâ€”"

"I can. And I will, if you force my hand." He straightened, and just like that, his expression shifted. Softened. Became Areeba's againâ€”or a convincing imitation of it. "So be a good sister. Keep your suspicions to yourself. And maybe, just maybe, we can all get through this trip without anyone getting hurt."

The bathroom door opened. Aunt Fareeda emerged in a cloud of steam, wrapped in a robe, toweling her hair.

"Bathroom's free," she announced. "Ayesha, why don't you go next?"

Ayesha couldn't move. Couldn't speak. She was still staring at Areeba, who smiled at herâ€”bright and innocent and completely normal.

"Go ahead, Ayesha," Areeba said sweetly. "You look like you could use a cold shower."

The double meaning wasn't lost on anyone, but Aunt Fareeda just laughed. "The water's barely lukewarm as it is!"

Somehow, Ayesha stood. Somehow, she gathered her clothes with numb fingers and walked to the bathroom. She closed the door behind her and locked it, then leaned against the sink, her whole body trembling.

*Areeba is fine. She'll be back.*

But for how long? And what would happen to her while that thing was in control?

*Keep your mouth shut.*

Ayesha looked at her reflection in the small, fogged mirror. She looked pale. Frightened. Young.

But beneath the fear, something else was hardening. Determination.

He wanted her to stay quiet. To play along. To let him have Areeba without a fight.

But he'd made a mistake. He'd confirmed what Ayesha suspected. He'd admitted Areeba was still in there, still fighting, still alive in some way.

Which meant she could still be saved.

Ayesha turned on the shower, letting the sound of water mask any noise, and made her decision.

She would play along. She would pretend to go along with his demands. But she wouldn't stop. She'd watch. She'd wait. She'd find a way to communicate with Areeba when she surfaced. She'd figure out what this thing was and how to get it out.

She didn't know how yet. Didn't know if it was even possible.

But she had to try.

Because that thing wearing Areeba's face had made one thing clear: he was dangerous. He was in control. And he had no intention of leaving.

Unless someone made him.

And if no one else could see what Ayesha saw, if no one else would believe her, then she'd have to do it alone.

She showered quickly, the lukewarm water doing nothing to wash away her fear or her resolve. When she emerged, the room had settled into pre-dinner preparation. Aunt Fareeda was getting dressed behind the bathroom door. Aunt Sadia was fixing her hair. 

Areeba sat on her bed, scrolling through her phoneâ€”or pretending to, since there was no signal. When Ayesha entered, she looked up and smiled. A private smile. A knowing smile.

A smile that said: *I own this situation. I own you. I own her.*

Ayesha looked away first, hating herself for it, but knowing she had to choose her battles carefully.

Outside the window, night had fallen completely over Naran. The mountains loomed black against a sky full of starsâ€”more stars than Ayesha had ever seen, so many they looked like someone had spilled salt across velvet.

Beautiful and cold and indifferent.

Just like the thing sitting across the room, wearing her sister's face, waiting.

Always watching.

Always in control.

For now.

# CHAPTER THREE: THE PACT

Morning light filtered through the curtains of Room 9, soft and golden. Ayesha woke to the sound of the azaan again, but this time she didn't feel peaceful. She'd barely slept, kept awake by the knowledge of whatâ€”*who*â€”lay in the bed across from her.

She turned her head slowly, dreading what she'd see.

Areeba was already awake, sitting up in bed, stretching her arms above her head with a yawn. When she lowered them, she looked over and caught Ayesha staring.

"Good morning!" Areeba's voice was bright, cheerful. Normal.

Ayesha's stomach clenched. Which one was this? Areeba or...?

"Morning," Ayesha managed, her voice rough with sleep and suspicion.

Areeba swung her legs out of bed and padded to the mirror, examining her reflection. She touched her face gently, ran her fingers through her tangled hair, studied herself with an expression Ayesha couldn't quite read. Not the strange, exploratory way a guy had looked at himself yesterday. This was different. Familiar. Like someone checking to make sure they were still themselves.

"How did you sleep?" Areeba asked, still looking at the mirror.

"Fine," Ayesha lied. "You?"

"Like the dead." Areeba laughed at her own joke, then paused, her smile faltering slightly. "Sorry. Bad choice of words."

Aunt Fareeda stirred in her bed, groaning. "What time is it?"

"Early," Aunt Sadia mumbled from under her pillow. "Too early."

"Uncle Jamil said we're leaving for Babusar Top at eight," Areeba said, turning from the mirror. "We should start getting ready."

Her movements were fluid, natural. She walked to her suitcase and knelt beside it, pulling out clothes with the careful consideration Areeba always used. A blue kameez with white embroidery. Matching pants. A coordinating dupatta.

Not the random, clashing outfit from yesterday.

Ayesha watched her, trying to understand. Yesterday morning, that Areeba had fumbled with the clothes, grabbed things randomly, didn't know how to braid hair. But now, Areeba was selecting an outfit with practiced ease.

"I'm going to shower first," Areeba announced, gathering her things. "If no one minds?"

"Go ahead, beta," Aunt Fareeda said, sitting up and rubbing her eyes.

Areeba disappeared into the bathroom, and Ayesha heard the water start running. She stared at the closed door, her mind racing.

Was that Areeba? The real Areeba? Or was the guy getting better at pretending?

The morning passed in the usual chaos of getting ready. Areeba emerged from the shower looking fresh and put togetherâ€”her hair neatly braided (she'd done it herself, Ayesha noted), light makeup applied with a practiced hand, outfit coordinated and appropriate.

She looked like Areeba.

She moved like Areeba.

She talked like Areeba, chatting with the aunts about what to pack for the day trip, laughing at Aunt Sadia's complaint about her aching back from yesterday's jeep ride.

But Ayesha couldn't trust it. Couldn't believe it. Not after last night's threat.

They made their way downstairs for breakfast. The hotel restaurant was small but busy, filled with tourists fueling up for their day trips. The smell of parathas and chai filled the air, mixing with the mountain breeze coming through open windows.

The family claimed two tables pushed together. Uncle Jamil was already there with the male cousins, nursing cups of tea and looking at maps on someone's phone.

"Babusar Top is three hours from here," Uncle Jamil explained as the women joined them. "Maybe four with stops. It's 13,691 feetâ€”much higher than Saif-ul-Malook. The views are supposed to be incredible."

"More jeep rides," Aunt Sadia said mournfully. "My back hasn't recovered from yesterday."

"Think of it as a massage," Uncle Tariq said with a grin. "A very aggressive, uncomfortable massage."

Everyone laughed. Even Areeba, her laugh light and genuine.

Ayesha picked at her paratha, barely tasting it. She watched Areeba interact with the familyâ€”passing salt to Uncle Jamil, joking with Faizan about his terrible sense of direction, helping little Hiba cut her omelet.

Normal. Everything was so normal.

After breakfast, they gathered in the lobby to wait for the jeeps. Ayesha found herself standing near Areeba, who was adjusting her dupatta and checking her small backpack.

"Can we talk?" Ayesha said quietly. "Alone?"

Areeba looked at her, and for just a moment, something flickered in her eyes. Hesitation? Fear? "Sure."

They stepped away from the group, moving to a quiet corner near the stairs. Ayesha waited until they were out of earshot before speaking.

"Who am I talking to?" she asked bluntly.

Areeba's expression didn't change, but her hands stilled on her backpack strap. "What do you mean?"

"You know what I mean. Are you Areeba? Or are you... him?"

A long pause. Then Areeba smiledâ€”but it was a sad smile, complicated. "I'm Areeba."

Relief flooded through Ayesha. "Are you okay? Did he hurt you? Can youâ€”"

"I'm also Faisal."

The relief died instantly.

Ayesha stared at her. "What?"

Areebaâ€”or whoever she wasâ€”glanced around to make sure no one was listening. When she spoke again, her voice was low, urgent. "It's hard to explain. We made an arrangement. A pact."

"A pact," Ayesha repeated, her voice flat. "You made a deal with the thing possessing you."

"He's not possessing me anymore. Not exactly." Areeba's hands twisted together. "We're... sharing. He gets time, I get time. We switch."

"That's insane. That'sâ€”you can't just share a body like it's a timeshare apartment!"

"What choice did I have?" Areeba's voice rose slightly, took on a defensive edge. Then she caught herself, lowered it again. "He was taking over completely. Pushing me down. I was disappearing, Ayesha. I could feel myself getting smaller, weaker. So I... I made a deal. We share. He lets me come back, lets me have control sometimes, and I let him stay."

"Let him stay?" Ayesha grabbed Areeba's arm. "Are you hearing yourself? You let aâ€”a spirit, a demon, whatever he isâ€”you let him stay in your body?"

Areeba pulled her arm free, and suddenly her expression changed. Hardened. When she spoke again, the voice was differentâ€”deeper, more masculine, even though the pitch was the same.

"She didn't have a choice," Faisal said from Areeba's mouth. "I would have taken everything. At least this way, she gets to live."

Ayesha stumbled back, horror washing over her. "Youâ€”you're both in there right now?"

"Always." The voice shifted againâ€”lighter now, definitely Areeba. "We're always both here. We just... take turns at the front."

"This is wrong," Ayesha breathed. "This is so wrong."

"It's survival," Faisal said, taking control again. His eyesâ€”Areeba's eyes but with that cold, male assessmentâ€”studied Ayesha. "You should be grateful. Your sister is alive. She's here. She can still laugh, talk, be with her family. That's more than she'd have if I'd consumed her completely."

"Give Areeba back," Ayesha demanded, trying to keep her voice steady. "All the way back. Get out of her body."

"No." Simple. Final.

"Ayesha, pleaseâ€”" Areeba's voice returned, pleading. "Please don't make this harder. I know it's weird, I know it's scary, but we've figured out how to make it work. He does the hard stuffâ€”"

"I do the difficult physical things," Faisal interjected. "The climbing, the carrying, anything that requires strength she doesn't have."

"â€”and I get to be myself for the normal things," Areeba continued. "The family time. The fun parts. It's not perfect, but it's better than the alternative."

Ayesha felt like she was going insane. She was watching her sister's face cycle through expressions, hearing two different people speak from the same mouth, seeing the shift in posture and mannerism as control changed hands.

"How can you be okay with this?" Ayesha asked Areeba. "How can you just... accept sharing your body with a stranger?"

Areeba's expression softened with something like sympathy. "Because I don't want to die. I don't want to disappear. And becauseâ€”" she hesitated, "â€”it's not as bad as you think. He's not evil. He's just... lost. He was trapped for so long, and now he can finally experience things again. Feel things. Live."

"Through your body!"

"Yes. Through my body." Areeba reached out and took Ayesha's hands. Her grip was warm, familiar. "I know this is hard to understand. I barely understand it myself. But we've worked something out. We have rules. Boundaries. He lets me have the times that matterâ€”being with family, having fun, being myself. And I let him have the times when I need himâ€”when things are hard, when I need to be strong, whenâ€”"

She cut herself off, but Ayesha caught the implication. When she needed to do things Areeba couldn't or wouldn't normally do.

"This is insane," Ayesha whispered. "You know this is insane, right?"

"Maybe," Areeba admitted. Then her expression changed againâ€”that subtle shift that meant Faisal was speaking. "But it's our reality now. And you need to accept it."

"I don't need to accept anything!"

"SHUT UP." 

The words came out harsh, sharpâ€”but Areeba's hand flew to her own mouth, her eyes wide with shock. When she lowered it, she was glaring at nothing, at the air, at herself.

"Let me talk to her," Areeba hissed to herself. "This is my sister. My family. Let me handle this."

Watching someone argue with themselves was surreal in a way Ayesha couldn't quite process. Areeba's face shifted through micro-expressionsâ€”anger, frustration, pleadingâ€”her lips moving silently as if having an internal conversation.

Which, Ayesha realized with creeping horror, she was.

Finally, Areeba's expression settled. She looked at Ayesha with tired eyes.

"I'm sorry," she said quietly. "We're still... figuring out the boundaries. He gets protective sometimes."

"Protective," Ayesha repeated numbly.

"He thinks you're going to try to separate us. Exorcise him or something." Areeba managed a weak smile. "But I told him you wouldn't. Because you understand that I'm choosing this. Right?"

The question hung between them, heavy with implication. If Ayesha tried to "save" Areeba against her will, she'd be betraying her sister's choice. But if she accepted this arrangement, she'd be allowing something unnatural to continue.

Before Ayesha could answer, Uncle Jamil's voice boomed across the lobby.

"Jeeps are here! Everyone ready?"

The family began moving toward the doors in a flurry of activity. Backpacks, cameras, water bottles. The children were already racing outside, excited for another adventure.

Areeba squeezed Ayesha's hands once more. "Please," she whispered. "Don't tell anyone. Don't try to fix this. It's working. I promise it's working."

Then she let go and turned toward the group, her face brightening into a smile as Hiba grabbed her hand and pulled her toward the door.

"Areeba apa, sit with me in the jeep!" the little girl demanded.

"Of course!" Areeba said, her voice full of warmth and affection. Completely normal. Completely herself.

Ayesha followed slowly, her mind reeling.

As they stepped out into the bright morning sunshine, she heard itâ€”Areeba's voice, barely a whisper, talking to herself as she walked.

"You do the hard stuff when we get there, okay? The climbing, the altitude. Let me be myself right now. I'll give you control back when we reach the top."

A pause. Then, in that slightly different tone:

"Fair enough. But when it's time for the difficult parts, you step aside."

"Deal."

They were negotiating. Making plans. Dividing up the day like two people sharing a shift.

Ayesha felt sick.

The jeeps waited outside, engines rumbling. The same battered Land Cruisers from yesterday, the drivers already looking resigned to another day of tourists and mountain roads.

"Same groups!" Uncle Jamil announced. "Let's move!"

Ayesha climbed into the jeep, taking her seat by the window. Aunt Fareeda settled beside her. Aunt Sadia took the front. And Areeba slid into the seat on Aunt Fareeda's other side, next to little Hiba.

As the jeep pulled away from Lalazar Hotel and merged into Naran Bazaar's morning traffic, Ayesha stared out the window, watching the mountains loom larger as they headed north.

Babusar Top. 13,691 feet. Even higher than yesterday. Thinner air. Harder terrain.

Perfect conditions for Areeba to need Faisal's strength.

Perfect conditions for him to take control.

Ayesha glanced over at her sister, who was braiding Hiba's hair, her fingers moving with practiced ease, her face soft with concentration and affection.

This was Areeba. Her sister, the only one.

But she was also Faisal. A stranger. An intruder. An entity that had no right to be there.

And somehow, impossibly, they were working together.

*You do the hard stuff, and let me be myself.*

Ayesha closed her eyes, leaning her head against the jeep window as they climbed out of the valley and into the higher mountains.

She had no idea what to do. No idea how to fix this. No idea if it even could be fixedâ€”or if Areeba even wanted it to be.

All she knew was that the trip to Babusar Top was going to change everything.

She could feel it in her bones.

The mountains knew it too. As they climbed higher, leaving the green valley behind for starker, more barren peaks, Ayesha could have sworn the mountains were watching.

Waiting.

To see what would happen when Areeba and Faisal were tested at the roof of the world.

# CHAPTER 7: THE GUARDIAN

The road to Babusar Top was worse than anything they'd experienced so far.

If the journey to Saif-ul-Malook had been uncomfortable, this was punishing. The jeeps crawled up switchbacks so tight the drivers had to reverse and adjust multiple times. The drop-offs were sheer and terrifyingâ€”thousands of feet of empty air with nothing but faith and bald tires between the passengers and oblivion.

Aunt Sadia had her eyes closed and her lips moving in constant prayer. Aunt Fareeda gripped the handle above her door so tightly her knuckles had gone white. Even the children were subdued, Hiba's earlier excitement dampened by genuine fear.

The landscape transformed as they climbed. The lush pine forests gave way to sparse vegetation, then to bare rock and patches of snow that clung to shadowed crevices even in summer. The sky deepened to a blue so intense it looked artificial.

And the air grew thin. So thin.

Ayesha felt it in her lungsâ€”each breath requiring conscious effort, never quite satisfying. Her head throbbed with a persistent ache that even the pills Aunt Fareeda had given her couldn't touch. Around her, she could see the same struggle in everyone else. Labored breathing. Pale faces. The altitude was affecting them all.

Everyone except Areeba.

She sat beside Hiba, perfectly comfortable, pointing out landmarks to the little girl in a cheerful voice that showed no breathlessness. Her color was good. Her movements fluid and energetic.

Impossible, Ayesha thought. At nearly 12,000 feet and climbing, everyone should be struggling.

They stopped at a checkpoint where a lone guard in a weathered uniform waved them through after a cursory check of documents. The jeeps pulled over briefly to let everyone stretch and acclimate.

Ayesha climbed out on shaky legs, immediately hit by a wall of cold that took her breath away. The temperature had dropped dramatically. What had been pleasantly cool in Naran was now genuinely frigid. The wind cut through her shawl like it wasn't there.

Around her, the family bundled into jackets and shawls, shivering and gasping in the thin air. Uncle Jamil looked pale and slightly green. Faizan was bent over, hands on his knees, breathing hard.

Areeba stood by the jeep, arms wrapped around herself, shivering visibly.

"So cold," she muttered, her teeth chattering. "So cold. I can'tâ€”"

She turned away from the group, facing the jeep, and Ayesha saw her lips move. Heard the whispered words carried on the mountain wind.

"It's so cold. It's your turn now."

Areeba's whole body went rigid for just a second. Her shoulders straightened. Her shivering stopped abruptly, like someone had flipped a switch.

When she turned back around, her expression had changed. The discomfort was gone. Replaced by that assessing, confident look Ayesha had come to recognize as Faisal.

He rolled Areeba's shoulders, testing them. Took a deep breath of the thin air and let it out slowly, unbothered by the altitude. Then he walked to the edge of the overlook and stared out at the mountains with an expression of pure satisfaction.

"Beautiful," he said, loud enough for the others to hear. But the tone was wrongâ€”too deep with appreciation, too masculine in its assessment.

Uncle Tariq joined him at the edge. "You're handling the altitude well, beta. Not feeling sick?"

Faisal shook his head, still staring at the view. "I feel great." He glanced at Uncle Tariq. "You don't look so good though, Uncle."

Uncle Tariq laughed weakly. "I'm getting too old for this. Stick to me, would you? In case I need someone to carry me back."

"No problem," Faisal said, and something in his voice suggested he meant it literally.

They climbed back into the jeeps and continued upward. The road deteriorated furtherâ€”less road now, more suggestion of where wheels had gone before. The jeeps rocked and bounced, throwing everyone around despite their grip on seats and handles.

Ayesha watched the switching happen twice more during the climb.

The first time was subtle. Faisal had been in control, his posture confident, his breathing unaffected. Then Hiba asked Areeba to help her with a tangled bracelet. For a moment, Faisal's expression flickered with something like confusionâ€”he clearly had no idea how to fix a child's bracelet.

Then Areeba's eyes softened. Her hands, which had been resting casually on her knees in a masculine sprawl, moved together and reached for the bracelet with practiced gentleness.

"Let me see, sweetheart," Areeba's voice said, warm and familiar.

She untangled the bracelet with deft fingers, explaining to Hiba how to avoid knotting it next time, her whole demeanor transformed back into the nurturing cousin Ayesha knew.

The switch had been seamless. No jerking, no slapping. Just a smooth transition, like two people trading seats.

They'd practiced this, Ayesha realized with a chill. They'd gotten good at it.

The second switch happened when they passed an especially terrifying section of road. A landslide had partially destroyed the path, leaving barely enough room for the jeep to squeeze through with inches to spare on either side. On the left, a rock wall. On the right, nothing but air and a drop that seemed to go on forever.

Aunt Sadia whimpered. Hiba buried her face in Areeba's side.

Areeba wrapped her arms around the little girl, murmuring comfort. "It's okay, baby. The driver knows what he's doing. We're safe."

But Ayesha saw Areeba's free hand clench into a fist. Saw her jaw tighten. Saw the flicker of fear cross her faceâ€”real fear, the kind Areeba would feel.

The kind Faisal wouldn't.

"I've got this," Ayesha heard her whisper to herself. Too quiet for anyone else to hear over the engine and Aunt Sadia's prayers. "Let me handle it."

Areeba's expression smoothed out. Her fist unclenched. She continued holding Hiba, but her body language changedâ€”became more alert, more ready. Like a bodyguard instead of a comforting cousin.

Faisal was back, protecting them through the dangerous passage.

Once they were through, Ayesha saw Areeba's shoulders relax slightly. Heard the whisper again: "Okay, I'm back. Thank you."

The gratitude in that whisper made Ayesha's chest tight. Areeba was thanking her possessor. Thanking him for protecting them.

They were becoming partners.

---

After three and a half grueling hours, the jeeps finally crested the last rise and Babusar Top spread before them.

It wasn't like Saif-ul-Malook with its fairy-tale lake. This was harsher. Starker. More alien. A high mountain pass surrounded by peaks that looked like they could scrape the belly of heaven. Snow clung to everything, brilliant white against dark rock and that impossible blue sky. The wind howled constantly, a living thing that pushed and pulled with indifferent force.

"13,691 feet!" the driver announced proudly as they parked in a rough lot where several other vehicles huddled together. "Top of the world!"

The family disembarked slowly, carefully, bodies struggling against altitude and exhaustion. The cold hit like a physical blowâ€”far worse than at the checkpoint. This wasn't just cold. This was the kind of cold that found every gap in clothing, every exposed inch of skin, and attacked it mercilessly.

"I can't breathe," Aunt Fareeda gasped, one hand on the jeep for support.

"Small breaths," Uncle Jamil instructed, though he looked like he was struggling too. "Don't overdo it. The oxygen is half what it is at sea level."

They bundled together, a family unit in a hostile environment. The children clung to their mothers. The men formed a protective circle around the women. Even the usually boisterous male cousins were quiet, awed and overwhelmed by the brutal beauty around them.

Faisal stood slightly apart, Areeba's body perfectly still, face turned toward the wind like he was drinking it in. He didn't shiver. Didn't gasp for breath. Just stood there, absorbing it all with an expression of transcendent joy.

"Areeba, come here!" Aunt Fareeda called. "You'll freeze!"

Reluctantly, Faisal moved back to the group. Aunt Fareeda immediately wrapped an extra shawl around Areeba's shoulders, fussing over her like she was one of the children.

"You're not even shivering," Aunt Fareeda said, concerned. "That's not good. That can be a sign of hypothermia."

"I'm fine, Auntie," Faisal said, his voice gentle but firm. "I'm just... warm-blooded, I guess."

They explored the area in a tight group, no one willing to stray far from the others. There was a small market hereâ€”a handful of stalls selling chai, corn, and souvenirs to the trickle of tourists brave or crazy enough to make the journey. The vendors huddled around portable heaters, wrapped in so many layers they looked twice their actual size.

"Chai?" one vendor called out, his breath misting. "Fresh, hot chai! Warm your bones!"

The offer was too good to refuse. They crowded into the man's small stall, grateful for the heat radiating from his portable stove. He served them chai in chipped cups, the liquid so hot it burned going down, but none of them cared. The warmth was worth it.

Ayesha wrapped her hands around her cup, trying to stop her fingers from going numb. Beside her, Areeba sipped her chai with a thoughtful expression.

"You should drink it faster," Faisal's voice said quietly. "Before it cools. The heat will help your body temperature."

Ayesha looked at him sharply. Practical advice. Survival advice. The kind of thing Areeba wouldn't necessarily know.

"Thanks," she said, her voice flat.

Faisal's lips quirked in something that wasn't quite a smile. "You're welcome."

They finished their chai and ventured back out into the cold. Uncle Jamil wanted photosâ€”the whole family together at Babusar Top. They arranged themselves on a relatively flat area with the mountains as backdrop, bundled and shivering, trying to smile for the camera.

"Say cheese!" Uncle Jamil called.

"PANEER!" the kids yelled back, and everyone laughed despite the cold.

The laughter died quickly as a group of young men approached from one of the other parked vehicles. Five of them, probably in their mid-twenties, wearing expensive jackets and carrying DSLRs. City boys on an adventure, their swagger suggesting this wasn't their first mountain trip.

They walked past the family, and Ayesha noticed their eyes lingeringâ€”on Aunt Fareeda, on Aunt Sadia, on herself and Areeba. Assessing. Appreciating in a way that made her skin crawl.

One of them, tall with a carefully groomed beard, deliberately walked close to Aunt Sadia, forcing her to step aside. His friends laughed.

"Excuse you," Uncle Jamil said, his voice carrying a warning.

"Sorry, Uncle," the bearded man said, not sounding sorry at all. His eyes were still on the women. "Didn't see you there."

They moved on, heading toward the vendor stalls, but Ayesha saw them looking back, talking among themselves, laughing.

"Jaahil," Aunt Fareeda muttered. Ignorant.

"City boys who think they own everything," Uncle Tariq agreed, his jaw tight.

They tried to continue with photos, but the mood had soured. The men stayed visible in the background, their voices carrying across the wind, making comments just loud enough to hear but not loud enough to definitively confront.

"Should have brought my sister on this trip..."

"...Check out the one in the blue..."

"Mountain girls are different, yaar..."

Uncle Jamil's expression darkened. "Stay close, everyone. We'll take our photos and leave."

But as they were arranging for another group shot, the bearded man and one of his friends wandered back, positioning themselves deliberately in the frame of every photo Uncle Jamil tried to take.

"Excuse me," Uncle Jamil said, his patience fraying. "We're trying to take family photos."

"Oh, sorry, sorry!" The bearded man movedâ€”but only a few feet, still close enough to be intrusive. His friend openly stared at Ayesha and Areeba, his gaze making Ayesha want to wrap her shawl tighter around herself.

"Let's just go," Aunt Sadia said quietly. "Please."

They started gathering their things, preparing to retreat to the jeeps. The harassment had been subtleâ€”no overt threats, nothing they could definitively call outâ€”but effective enough to ruin their experience.

Ayesha was helping Hiba with her jacket when she heard Aunt Fareeda's sharp gasp.

She turned to see the bearded man standing too close to her aunt, his hand having "accidentally" brushed against her as he "stumbled" on the uneven ground.

"So sorry, Auntie," he said, his smirk contradicting his words. "These rocks are dangerous."

Uncle Jamil moved forward, anger flashing across his face. "That's enoughâ€”"

But someone else moved faster.

Areebaâ€”or rather, Faisalâ€”crossed the distance in three long strides and placed himself directly between the bearded man and Aunt Fareeda. Areeba's body was smaller, slighter than the man's, but the way Faisal held itâ€”shoulders squared, stance wide, weight balancedâ€”made it clear this was no frightened girl.

"Apologize," Faisal said, his voice low and deadly serious. "Properly."

The bearded man blinked, surprised. Then he laughed. "What? Look at this, boys! The little girl wants to play hero!"

His friends had noticed the confrontation and were walking over, grins on their faces, sensing entertainment.

"Areeba, come here," Uncle Jamil said, trying to defuse the situation. "Let me handle this."

But Faisal didn't move. His eyesâ€”Areeba's eyes, but with something ancient and dangerous behind themâ€”stayed locked on the bearded man.

"I said apologize. To the lady. Now."

The bearded man's smile faltered. Something in Areeba's stance, in the absolute lack of fear in her voice, made him uncertain. "Or what? What are you going to do, little girl?"

"Faisal, don'tâ€”" Ayesha started, then caught herself. But it was too late.

Faisal had heard his name. A small smile crossed Areeba's faceâ€”cold and predatory.

"Or I'll make you," he said simply.

The bearded man laughed again, but it sounded forced now. He moved forward, reaching out to push Areeba asideâ€”

Faisal caught his wrist.

The movement was so fast Ayesha almost missed it. One moment the man was reaching, the next his wrist was trapped in Areeba's small hand, and the man's face had gone white with pain.

"Whatâ€”" he gasped, trying to pull free. He couldn't. Areeba's fingers were locked around his wrist like iron.

"Apologize," Faisal repeated, his voice calm. He applied more pressure, and the bearded man actually whimpered.

"Let go of him!" one of the friends moved forward.

"Stay back," Uncle Jamil commanded, his shock giving way to protective instinct. He and Uncle Tariq positioned themselves between the other men and Areeba, even though they had no idea what was happening.

The bearded man tried to wrench his arm free, tried to use his size and weight advantage. Faisal didn't budge. He twisted the wrist slightlyâ€”some kind of joint lock that Ayesha had only seen in action moviesâ€”and the man cried out, actually dropping to one knee.

"I'm sorry!" he gasped. "I'm sorry, okay? Let go!"

"To her," Faisal said, nodding toward Aunt Fareeda. "Not to me."

The man, his face red with pain and humiliation, looked at Aunt Fareeda. "I'm sorry, Auntie. I'm very sorry. It was wrong. Pleaseâ€”"

Faisal released him.

The bearded man stumbled backward, cradling his wrist, his friends catching him. They all stared at Areeba with expressions mixing confusion, fear, and wounded masculine pride.

"How did youâ€”" the bearded man started.

"Leave," Faisal said quietly. "Now. Before I really get angry."

The threat, coming from a woman half their size, should have been laughable. But something in Areeba's eyes, in her posture, in the absolute confidence with which she'd just dominated a man twice her size, made it terrifying.

They left. Quickly. Practically running back to their vehicle, the bearded man still clutching his wrist.

Silence fell over the family.

Everyone was staring at Areeba. At sweet, gentle Areeba who'd never been in a fight in her life. Areeba who squealed at spiders. Areeba who'd just executed a joint lock that could have broken a man's wrist.

"Areeba," Uncle Jamil said slowly. "What... how did you do that?"

Faisal looked down at Areeba's hands, flexing the fingers like he was surprised by what they'd accomplished. Then that cold confidence melted away, and Areeba's usual expression flooded backâ€”confused, a little scared, uncertain.

The switch had happened in the span of a heartbeat.

"I... I don't know," Areeba said, her voice small and shaky. She looked at her own hand like it belonged to someone else. "He was going to hurt Aunt Fareeda and I just... I reacted. I didn't think."

"Where did you learn to do that?" Faizan asked, awed and a little frightened. "That was like something from a movie!"

"I don't know," Areeba repeated. She looked at Aunt Fareeda, her eyes filling with tears. "Are you okay, Auntie? Did he hurt you?"

"I'm fine, beta," Aunt Fareeda said, her voice unsteady. She pulled Areeba into a hug. "You... you saved me. I don't know how, but you saved me."

Over Aunt Fareeda's shoulder, Areeba's eyes met Ayesha's. And in them, Ayesha saw bothâ€”Areeba's genuine concern for her aunt, and beneath it, Faisal's satisfaction at having protected someone under his care.

Two souls, one body. Working together now not just to coexist, but to protect.

"We should go," Uncle Tariq said, glancing toward where the men had fled. Their jeep was starting up, backing away quickly. "Before they come back with reinforcements or call the police."

They hurried to their own jeeps, the cold and altitude forgotten in the adrenaline rush. As they piled in, Ayesha heard the whispers againâ€”Areeba talking to herself, or rather, to her passenger.

"Thank you for protecting her."

A pause.

"That's what family does."

Another pause.

"We're not family."

"No. But she is. And you care about her. So I care about her."

The logic was twisted, impossible, wrong. But also, in some strange way, touched by grace.

As the jeeps began their descent from Babusar Top, Ayesha leaned her head back and closed her eyes. Her mind spun with what she'd just witnessed.

Faisal had used Areeba's body to fight. Had accessed knowledge and skills Areeba didn't possess. Had dominated a grown man with the form of a slight woman.

And more terrifyinglyâ€”he'd done it to protect the family.

Not to hurt. Not to show off. But to protect.

What did that mean? What was he? A demon protecting the family he'd invaded? A spirit forming bonds with people who weren't even his?

The questions multiplied with every switchback descent, every meter they dropped back toward breathable air and sane reality.

Beside her, Areeba sat quietly, staring out the window. Her lips moved occasionally in those silent conversations. Her hands rested peacefully in her lap.

She looked so normal.

So completely, utterly normal.

Except she wasn't.

And Ayesha had no idea what to do about it.

# CHAPTER 8: BOUNDARIES

The descent from Babusar Top took nearly four hours. By the time the jeeps rolled back into Naran Bazaar, the sun was setting behind the mountains, painting everything in shades of amber and rose gold. Everyone was exhaustedâ€”the kind of bone-deep weariness that came from thin air, constant adrenaline, and bodies pushed beyond comfortable limits.

Everyone except Areeba.

She climbed out of the jeep with energy that should have been impossible after such a grueling day. While the others moved like elderly people, groaning and holding their backs, Areeba stretched casually and grabbed bags to help carry inside.

"Beta, you don't have toâ€”" Aunt Sadia started.

"It's fine, Auntie!" Areeba hoisted two bags easily, one on each shoulder. "I've got it."

Uncle Jamil watched her with an expression mixing pride and confusion. "I don't know where you get your energy. When I was your age, maybe. But now?" He rubbed his lower back ruefully.

Faisalâ€”because it was definitely Faisal carrying those bagsâ€”just smiled. "Good genes, Uncle."

They trudged into Lalazar Hotel's lobby, which now felt warm and welcoming after the brutal cold of the mountain pass. The smell of cooking meat and fresh naan wafted from the restaurant, making stomachs growl despite exhaustion.

"Dinner in thirty minutes," Uncle Jamil announced. "Just enough time to freshen up and pray Maghrib."

The family separated to their rooms. Ayesha climbed the stairs slowly, each step requiring conscious effort. Her legs felt like lead. Her head still ached from the altitude. All she wanted was to collapse on her bed and not move for several hours.

Behind her, Areeba climbed the stairs carrying two heavy bags without breaking a sweat.

Inside Room 9, Aunt Fareeda and Aunt Sadia immediately claimed the beds, lying down with grateful sighs.

"I'm too old for this," Aunt Sadia moaned. "Tomorrow we're doing something flat. A nice, flat market. No mountains."

"Agreed," Aunt Fareeda said, her eyes already closing. "Just give me ten minutes before dinner..."

Within moments, both aunts were dozing, their breathing deep and even.

Which left Ayesha and Areeba alone. Awake. With thirty minutes until dinner.

Ayesha sat on her bed, pulling off her shoes with a wince. Her feet were swollen from the altitude and the hours cramped in the jeep. She glanced across the room at Areeba, who had set down the bags and was now moving around the room, putting things away, organizing, restless.

"You should rest," Ayesha said quietly, careful not to wake the aunts.

"Not tired," Areeba said. Then she paused, tilted her head slightly, listening to something Ayesha couldn't hear. "Well, I am. But not enough to sleep."

Ayesha studied her sister. The transitions had become so smooth nowâ€”so seamlessâ€”that she could barely tell when the switch happened unless she was really watching. But she could still see the tells. The way Areeba's posture would shift. The way her expressions would change, subtle but distinct.

Right now, watching Areeba move around the room with that efficient, purposeful energy, Ayesha was pretty sure she was watching Faisal.

"Can I ask you something?" Ayesha said.

Areeba stopped, turned to face her. "Sure."

"How does it work? The switching. Does it hurt?"

A pause. Then Areeba came and sat on Ayesha's bed, cross-legged, her posture open. When she spoke, her voice was Areeba's, but thoughtful in a way that suggested both of them were answering.

"No. It doesn't hurt. Not anymore. At first it was... jarring. Disorienting. Like being pushed under water and then suddenly breaking the surface, over and over. But now..." She searched for words. "Now it's more like... stepping back and letting someone else drive. I'm still there. Still aware. Just not in control."

"So you can see everything? Even when he's in control?"

"Yes. I'm always aware. Always present." Areeba's expression shifted slightlyâ€”Faisal taking over the conversation. "And I'm always aware of her. It's like... sharing headphones. We both hear the music, but only one of us is choosing the song at any given time."

The metaphor was oddly poetic. Ayesha didn't know how to respond.

"What about feelings?" she asked instead. "Do you feel what he feels? Does he feel what you feel?"

"Yes," they said in unison. Then Areeba laughedâ€”a strange, layered sound that was somehow both of them. "Sorry. We both wanted to answer that one. Yes, we feel everything. When I'm happy, he feels it. When he's angry, I feel it. It's..."

"Intimate," Faisal finished, his tone making it clear this was both statement and complaint.

"It must be overwhelming," Ayesha said.

"It was. Less so now. We've learned to... give each other space. Mentally, if not physically." Areeba's expression flickered againâ€”a rapid back-and-forth like they were debating who should speak. Finally, Areeba settled. "He's getting better at staying quiet when I need him to. And I'm getting better at letting him have the front when he needs it."

"Like today. At Babusar Top."

"Yes." Areeba's voice was soft, grateful. "I was so cold. So tired. And scared when those men showed up. I couldn't have handled any of it. But he could. He did."

"You thanked him," Ayesha said. "I heard you."

Areeba nodded. "He saved Aunt Fareeda. Of course I thanked him."

It was surreal. Listening to her sister talk about her possessor like a roommate. A partner. Someone deserving of gratitude and consideration.

"Aren't you angry?" Ayesha asked. "At what he did to you? Taking over your body without permission?"

Areeba was quiet for a long moment. Outside, the call to Maghrib prayer echoed from the mosque down the street. Inside, Aunt Fareeda stirred in her sleep but didn't wake.

"I was," Areeba finally said. "At first. I was terrified. Furious. I fought so hard to push him out." She looked at her hands. "But he was stronger. And I was disappearing. Bit by bit, piece by piece, I could feel myself getting smaller. Getting lost."

"So you made a deal to survive."

"Yes. But it's more than that now." Areeba met Ayesha's eyes. "He's not what I thought. He's not evil. He's not trying to hurt me or use me for something terrible. He's just... lost. He was trapped for so long in nothing, nowhere, and when I came throughâ€”whatever threshold I crossedâ€”he saw a chance to live again. To feel. To experience the world."

"Through you."

"Through me," Areeba agreed. "And yes, that's not fair. I know that. But life isn't fair. And between being completely consumed and sharing... I chose sharing."

Ayesha wanted to argue. Wanted to tell her sister this was wrong, unnatural, that there had to be another way. But what way? She had no idea how to exorcise a spirit. No idea if it was even possible without hurting Areeba in the process.

"Does the family suspect?" Ayesha asked instead. "About... him?"

"No. Just you." Areeba smiled slightly. "You always were more observant than the others. But they just think I'm recovering from the fainting spells. That I'm acting a bit strange because of stress or altitude or head trauma."

"What you did todayâ€”that wrist lockâ€”someone's going to start asking questions."

"Maybe." Areeba shrugged. "We'll say I took self-defense classes. Muscle memory kicked in. They'll believe it because they want to believe it. Because the alternative is too strange."

She was right. People believed what made sense to them. What fit their worldview. A possessed sister sharing her body with a male spirit? That was too far outside normal for most people to accept.

"I won't tell them," Ayesha said quietly. "I still think this is wrong. Unnatural. But... I won't tell them. Not unless you want me to."

Relief flooded Areeba's faceâ€”pure Areeba, grateful and loving. "Thank you. Really. Thank you."

She reached out and squeezed Ayesha's hand. Her grip was warm, solid, real. This was still her sister. Still the girl she'd grown up with, shared secrets with, loved like a sister.

Just... not only her anymore.

A knock on the door made them both jump.

"Ladies?" Uncle Jamil's voice called. "Dinner in five minutes!"

"Coming!" Ayesha called back.

The aunts woke with groans and protests, struggling to vertical positions. The room filled with the familiar chaos of getting readyâ€”fixing hair, adjusting dupattas, finding shoes.

Ayesha watched Areeba move through it all, chatting with the aunts, laughing at Aunt Sadia's complaints, perfectly normal and perfectly herself.

No one else could see what Ayesha saw. The slight tilt of the head when Faisal was listening. The way Areeba's expression would go momentarily blank when they were having an internal conversation.

They went down to dinner as a family. The restaurant was warm and loud, filled with other tourists sharing stories of their mountain adventures. The family claimed a large table, and food arrived in generous portionsâ€”karahi, daal, fresh naan, rice.

Everyone ate with the intensity of people who'd burned thousands of calories in thin mountain air. Conversation flowed, stories were retold and embellished, laughter echoed.

Ayesha picked at her food, her appetite dulled by exhaustion and the day's revelations. Across the table, Areeba ate with enthusiasm, responding to questions about how she'd learned that "impressive defensive move."

"Just some self-defense classes," Areeba said modestly. "My instructor said I was a natural."

"You should teach us!" Aunt Fareeda said. "Especially in times like these, when men think they can do whatever they want."

"Maybe," Areeba said, and Ayesha caught the flicker of Faisal's satisfaction in her eyes. He liked being useful. Being needed.

After dinner, the family lingered over chai, too full and comfortable to move. The children had fallen asleep in their chairs. The adults talked in the lazy, meandering way of people with nowhere to be.

Finally, Uncle Jamil yawned and checked his watch. "It's late. Tomorrow we rest. No mountains. Just the bazaar, maybe some shopping. Everyone sleep in."

The proclamation was met with grateful murmurs. They made their way upstairs slowly, bodies heavy with food and fatigue.

Back in Room 9, the aunts went through their nighttime routines quickly, eager for bed. Ayesha changed into her sleep clothes and collapsed onto her bed with a sigh of relief.

Across the room, Areeba sat on her bed, braiding her hair for the night. Her movements were practiced, automatic. Definitely Areebaâ€”Faisal wouldn't know how to do this.

The aunts' breathing deepened into sleep within minutes. The room fell quiet except for the distant sounds of the bazaar outsideâ€”voices, music, the occasional car horn.

Ayesha was drifting toward sleep when she heard itâ€”Areeba's voice, whisper-soft, talking to herself.

"You should sleep too."

A pause.

"Not tired." Faisal's tone, but quiet.

"You've been active all day. You carried those bags. You need rest."

"I don't sleep the same way you do."

"What does that mean?"

Ayesha kept her eyes closed, pretending to sleep, listening to the impossible conversation.

"I don't need to sleep when you sleep," Faisal explained, his voice patient. "When you're resting, I can... observe. Think. Process. I'm still conscious even when you're not."

"That sounds lonely."

A long pause. Then, quieter: "It is. Sometimes."

"I'm sorry."

"Don't be. This is better than before. Than the nothing."

Another pause. Ayesha heard the rustle of blankets as Areeba settled into bed.

"Can I ask you something?" Areeba's voice was small, vulnerable.

"Of course."

"Are you going to stay forever? Or is this temporary? Will you leave when... when the trip is over?"

The silence stretched so long Ayesha thought Faisal might not answer. Then:

"I don't know. I don't know if I can leave. Or if I want to. I'm sorry. I know that's not what you want to hear."

"I don't know what I want to hear," Areeba admitted. "Part of me wants you gone. Wants my body back, completely mine. But part of me..." She trailed off.

"Part of you what?"

"Part of me would miss you. Is that crazy? You invaded me. Took over my body. I should hate you. But when you protected Aunt Fareeda today, when you helped me through the cold at Babusar Top... I was grateful. Not just for the help, but for the company. For not being alone in my own head."

Ayesha's chest tightened at the confession. Areeba was forming a bond with her possessor. Not just accepting him out of necessity, but actually developing... what? Friendship? Partnership?

"I would miss you too," Faisal said quietly. "You're... kind. Brave. You could have fought me harder. Made this unbearable for both of us. But you chose cooperation. I've never experienced that before."

"Before? You mean you've done this before? Possessed other people?"

"No. Never. I tried, over the years. But I was too weak. Too formless. You're the first who was... compatible. The first I could actually connect with."

"Lucky me," Areeba said, but there was no bitterness in it. Almost affection.

"Lucky us," Faisal corrected.

Ayesha heard Areeba shifting in bed, getting comfortable. Then her voice again, firmer now:

"Hey."

"What?"

"I'm about to have girl talk with Ayesha tomorrow. About private stuff. You stay quiet for that, understand? Don't get into girls talk."

A pause. Then Faisal's amused response: "Girl talk. You mean aboutâ€”"

"Private. Stuff. Not for you."

"I'm literally inside your head. How exactly am I supposed to not hear?"

"You can hear, but you don't comment. You don't contribute. You just... think about something else. Go to your mental corner."

"I don't have a mental corner."

"Then find one. Make one. I don't care. But some things are just for girls, and you need to respect that boundary."

Ayesha almost smiled despite everything. Areeba was setting boundaries with her possessor like he was a nosy roommate.

"Fine," Faisal said, and he actually sounded chastened. "I'll... think about mountains or something when you have girl talk."

"Thank you." A pause. "Now let me sleep. I'm exhausted."

"I told you to sleep hours ago."

"And I told you I'll sleep when I want to. You can sleep without me sleeping, remember? You just said that. So if you're tired, sleep. Don't wait for me."

"I wanted to make sure you were comfortable. Safe."

The protective tone in Faisal's voice made something in Ayesha's chest twist. He cared about Areeba. Genuinely cared.

"I'm safe," Areeba said softly. "We're in a hotel with family all around us. Nothing's going to happen. You can rest. Or observe. Or whatever it is you do. But stop hovering."

"I don't hover."

"You literally hover inside my consciousness. That's the definition of hovering."

A sound that might have been Faisal's laughâ€”or Areeba imagining his laugh. The line was blurring.

"Good night, Faisal."

"Good night, Areeba."

Silence fell. Ayesha lay in the darkness, processing what she'd heard. They weren't just coexisting anymore. They were developing routines. Setting boundaries. Having actual conversations that sounded almost... domestic.

The possession was becoming a partnership. The invasion was becoming a relationship.

And Ayesha had no idea if that made things better or infinitely worse.

She fell asleep to the sound of Areeba's gentle breathing and the whisper of the mountain wind outside, carrying secrets the world wasn't ready to know.

# CHAPTER 9: CONVERGENCE

Ayesha woke to whispers.

For a disorienting moment, she thought she was dreaming. But noâ€”the whispers were real, coming from across the room where dawn light filtered through the curtains in pale strips.

She opened her eyes carefully, not moving, and looked toward Areeba's bed.

Her sister sat upright, her back against the headboard, having what could only be described as an argument with herself. Her expressions shifted rapidlyâ€”annoyed, then amused, then fond, then exasperatedâ€”her lips moving in conversation with someone only she could hear.

Except it wasn't just in her head anymore.

Ayesha blinked, certain she was still asleep. Because standing beside Areeba's bed, translucent in the early morning light, was the figure of a young man.

He wasn't solid. More like a projection, a hologram made of mist and morning sun. But he had a shape nowâ€”tall, lean, probably mid-twenties, with features that were handsome in a sharp, angular way. He wore what looked like traditional clothes from another era, though the details kept shifting, never quite stable.

And he was gesturing while he talked, clearly in the middle of making some point to Areeba.

Ayesha's breath caught.

The figure flickered, then dissolved like smoke, and suddenly Areeba's posture changedâ€”became more masculine, more confident. Faisal had gone back inside.

"I'm just saying," Faisal's voice came from Areeba's mouth, quiet enough not to wake the aunts, "if you're going to be stubborn about this, at least admit you're being stubborn."

Areeba took control backâ€”the shift visible in the softening of her expression. "I'm not stubborn. I'm practical. There's a difference."

"You're both," Faisal said, manifesting outside again for just a momentâ€”that ghostly form beside the bed, his arms crossed. "And you know I'm right."

"You're impossible," Areeba whispered, but she was smiling.

The form dissolved again, back inside. The transitions were happening so fast now, so seamlessly, like a conversation between two people in the same room instead of two people sharing the same body.

Ayesha sat up slowly, and bothâ€”all?â€”of them noticed.

"Oh," Areeba said, her cheeks flushing. "You're awake. How much did youâ€”"

"I saw him," Ayesha said quietly. "Outside. How is that possible?"

Areeba bit her lip, glancing at the sleeping aunts to make sure they were still out. Then she slipped from her bed and padded over to Ayesha, sitting on the edge of her mattress.

"He can leave now," Areeba whispered. "Not far. Just a few feet. And not for long. But our connection is strong enough that he can... manifest. Partially."

"Since when?"

"Last night. We figured it out by accident. I was trying to give him spaceâ€”mentally, you know?â€”and he just... slipped out. For a few seconds." Areeba's eyes were bright, excited. "We've been practicing. He's getting better at holding the form."

Ayesha stared at her. "Areeba, do you understand how insane this is? How much deeper this goes? First he's possessing you, then you're sharing, and now he can just... leave and come back?"

"Only because we're in sync," Areeba said, and there was something almost defensive in her tone. "Our wills are matched. He can't take control anymore unless I let him. And I can't push him out unless he wants to go. It's... equal now."

"Equal," Ayesha repeated. "You sound likeâ€”"

Like partners, she'd been about to say. Like two people in a relationship.

Areeba's blush deepened, confirming Ayesha's unspoken thought.

"It's not like that," Areeba said, but she didn't sound convincing. "We're just... we've gotten close. That's all. He understands me better than anyone. He's literally in my head. He knows every thought, every feeling, everyâ€”"

"Every breath, every heartbeat, every moment," Faisal said, taking control mid-sentence, his tone gentle. "She's not alone anymore. And neither am I."

The intimacy in those words made Ayesha uncomfortable in a way she couldn't quite articulate.

"This isn't healthy," she said carefully. "This level of... enmeshment. You're two separate beingsâ€”"

"Are we?" Faisal asked, and the question was genuine. "Where does she end and I begin anymore? We share thoughts. Feelings. Experiences. We're becomingâ€”"

"Don't say it," Ayesha warned.

"â€”one," Faisal finished quietly.

Silence fell between them. From the other beds, Aunt Fareeda snored softly. Outside, Naran was waking upâ€”the sound of shop shutters rolling up, the call of street vendors, the morning azaan.

"Get dressed," Ayesha said finally. "Let's talk on the balcony. Privately."

---

Twenty minutes later, Ayesha and Areeba sat on the small balcony attached to their room. It was barely big enough for two chairs and a tiny table, overlooking the main bazaar street below. The morning air was crisp and cool, carrying the scent of fresh naan from the bakery three shops down.

Areebaâ€”currently Areeba, Ayesha was fairly certainâ€”wrapped her shawl tighter around her shoulders and cradled a cup of chai they'd gotten from the restaurant downstairs. Her expression was peaceful, content in a way Ayesha hadn't seen in days.

"You're really okay with this?" Ayesha asked. "Sharing your body forever?"

"Forever..." Areeba said. "Let's say... for now. And yes, I'm okay with it." She took a sip of chai. "More than okay. Ayesha, I know you're worried. I know this seems wrong to you. But you have to understandâ€”I'm not giving up anything I can't spare. And what I'm getting in return..."

"What are you getting?"

"Strength. Courage. Someone who understands me completely. Someone who'll never leave me." Areeba stared out at the mountains. "Do you know how lonely I was before? How much I struggled with anxiety, with feeling weak, with being afraid all the time?"

"You were fineâ€”"

"I was pretending," Areeba cut her off. "I was always pretending to be fine. But with Faisal, I don't have to pretend. He knows everythingâ€”every fear, every insecurity, every shameful thoughtâ€”and he's still here. He still chooses to be with me."

The words sounded less like possession and more like a confession of love.

Before Ayesha could respond, Areeba's expression shiftedâ€”Faisal coming forward.

"Do you want to understand?" he asked Ayesha. "Really understand what this is like for her?"

"What do you mean?"

Faisal leaned forward, Areeba's eyes holding an intensity that was purely his. "I could show you. Just for a moment. Let you feel what she feels. Experience what we share."

Ayesha's pulse quickened. "How?"

"I could step into you. Briefly. Just long enough for you to feel the connection. To understand why she doesn't want this to end."

The offer hung in the air between them. Ayesha's mind raced. To know what Areeba was experiencing. To truly understand instead of just observing from the outside. To finally grasp what was happening to her.

"No."

The word came from Areebaâ€”sharp, immediate, possessive. She'd taken control back so fast that Faisal barely had time to register surprise.

"Absolutely not," Areeba continued, her voice firm. "This is... no. You can't do that."

"I was just offering to help her understandâ€”" Faisal's voice, confused.

"I don't care. You're not stepping into anyone else." Areeba's cheeks were flushed now, her eyes bright with something that looked suspiciously like jealousy. "This is... this is cheating!"

Ayesha blinked. "Cheating?"

Areeba seemed to realize what she'd said. Her flush deepened to crimson. "I just meant... it's not appropriate. You can't just... share yourself with other people. That's not how this works."

"I didn't realize there were rules," Faisal said dryly, still speaking through Areeba but clearly amused by her reaction.

"Well there are now!" Areeba's hands clenched around her chai cup. "You're... you're mine. This body is mine. This connection is ours. You don't get to just... experience it with someone else!"

The possessiveness in her voice was unmistakable. Ayesha watched her sister's internal struggle play out across her faceâ€”embarrassment warring with that fierce, protective instinct.

"Areeba," Faisal's voice was gentle now, "are you jealous?"

"No!" Too fast. Too defensive. Then, quieter: "Maybe. Yes. I don't know." She set down her chai cup with shaking hands. "Is that crazy? To be jealous over something like this?"

"It's not crazy," Faisal said, and his voice carried such warmth that Ayesha felt like she was intruding on an intimate moment. "It's... actually kind of sweet."

Areeba made a sound that was half laugh, half groan, and buried her face in her hands. "I can't believe I just said that out loud. In front of Ayesha."

Ayesha didn't know whether to laugh or be concerned. "So... you two are..."

"It's complicated," Areeba said, her voice muffled by her hands.

"It's really not," Faisal said. "We'reâ€”"

"Don't," Areeba warned, dropping her hands. "Don't put a label on it. That makes it weirder than it already is."

"How could it possibly be weirder?"

"You're a disembodied spirit sharing my body!"

"And yet here we are, having a relationship discussion on a balcony in Naran."

Areeba laughedâ€”a real laugh, bright and genuine. And for a moment, the ghostly form manifested beside her chairâ€”Faisal's translucent figure, smiling down at her with unmistakable affection.

Ayesha watched the form, trying to memorize details. He looked young. Kind. Not at all like the malevolent entity she'd imagined when this all started.

"How did you die?" Ayesha asked suddenly. "What were you before this?"

The form flickered, becoming less stable. Faisal's smile faded.

"I don't remember," he said, his voice carrying an echo quality when he was manifested outside. "I remember being alive. Being human. And then... nothing. Darkness. Emptiness. For what felt like forever. And then Areeba."

"He was trapped," Areeba said softly. "Somehow. Somewhere. And when I fainted on the bus, when whatever barrier exists betweenâ€”" she gestured vaguely, "â€”here and there got thin, he slipped through."

"I didn't mean to possess you," Faisal said. "I just wanted to feel again. To exist. And you were so... bright. So alive. I couldn't help reaching for you."

"And accidentally taking over my entire body," Areeba added, but there was no accusation in her tone. Just statement of fact.

"And accidentally taking over your entire body," Faisal agreed. His form dissolved again, slipping back inside. "I'm still sorry about that."

"I know," Areeba said. "I forgave you."

The easy forgiveness, the gentle tone, the way they spoke to each otherâ€”it all pointed to something Ayesha was afraid to name.

"What happens when we go back to Lahore?" Ayesha asked. "When the trip ends? Do you really think you can hide this forever?"

Areeba's smile faded. "I don't know. We haven't thought that far ahead."

"You should. Because eventually someone's going to notice. Someone's going to see him manifest, or hear you talking to yourself, or realize you can do things normal people can't do."

"We'll be careful," Areeba said.

"You're talking to yourself right now. In public. On a balcony where anyone could see."

Areeba glanced down at the street below, where early morning shoppers were beginning to appear. "Good point. We should probably go inside."

They gathered their chai cups and went back into the room. The aunts were stirring, starting their morning routines. The day was beginningâ€”their rest day, the day with no mountains, just leisurely shopping in the bazaar.

As Ayesha changed clothes and got ready, she watched Areeba interact with the aunts. Watched the subtle shifts that indicated conversation with Faisal. Watched her sister smile at private jokes and respond to comments no one else could hear.

The family had noticed. They had to have. But they were choosing to interpret it charitablyâ€”as residual confusion from the fainting spells, as harmless eccentricity, as anything other than what it actually was.

Because the truth was impossible.

And people would go to great lengths to avoid believing the impossible.

---

By mid-morning, the family had gathered in the lobby, ready for a casual day of shopping and exploration. No jeeps, no altitude, no exhausting climbsâ€”just the colorful chaos of Naran Bazaar with its shops selling everything from hand-embroidered shawls to carved wooden trinkets to dubious "gemstones."

"Remember," Uncle Jamil announced, "we meet back at the hotel at one o'clock for lunch. Don't wander too far, and keep your phones on even if there's no signal."

"There's never signal," Faizan muttered, but he was smiling.

They split into smaller groups. The men went one direction, drawn by a shop selling hunting knives and camping gear. Aunt Sadia took the younger children to look at toys. Which left Ayesha, Areeba, and Aunt Fareeda to explore the textile shops.

The bazaar was alive with color and sound. Vendors called out their wares in Urdu, Pashto, and broken English. Tourists haggled over prices. Locals went about their daily business, navigating around the seasonal flood of visitors with practiced ease.

Aunt Fareeda dove into a shop selling pashmina shawls, immediately engaging the owner in spirited negotiation. Ayesha and Areeba followed more slowly, running their hands over the impossibly soft fabric.

"This one," Areeba said, holding up a deep blue shawl shot through with silver thread. "What do you think?"

"It's beautiful," Ayesha said. "Very you."

"Faisal likes it too," Areeba said without thinking. Then she caught herself, glancing around to make sure Aunt Fareeda was out of earshot. "Sorry. I keep forgetting to filter."

"You're getting too comfortable," Ayesha warned quietly. "You just referred to him out loud."

"I know, I know." Areeba lowered her voice. "It's just... he has opinions. About everything. And sometimes I forget that other people can't hear him sharing those opinions."

As if to demonstrate, Areeba's expression shiftedâ€”a micro-conversation happening at lightning speed. She smiled at something, nodded slightly, then looked back at Ayesha.

"He says you should get the green one. It brings out your eyes."

Despite everything, Ayesha found herself looking at the green shawl. It was beautiful, a soft sage color with delicate embroidery.

"Tell him thank you," Ayesha said dryly. "And also that it's weird getting fashion advice from a century-old ghost."

"I'm not a century old," Faisal's voice said through Areeba's mouth. "I think. Time is weird when you're... wherever I was."

"And you're very welcome," Areeba added. "He says."

They moved through the bazaar, and Ayesha watched her sister with a mixture of fascination and concern. The conversations with Faisal were constant nowâ€”brief exchanges, shared observations, private jokes. Areeba would smile at nothing, or laugh suddenly, or nod in agreement with something only she could hear.

At one shop, Areeba picked up a traditional men's waistcoat, examining it with interest.

"This would look good on you," she said to the empty air beside her. Then she blushed, realizing what she'd done, and put it back quickly.

At another, she paused in front of a jewelry stall, looking at the rings.

"Don't even think about it," she muttered to herself. "We're not there yet. We're not... stop laughing at me."

Her face went red, and she hurried away from the stall, leaving Ayesha to wonder what exactly Faisal had suggested.

By the time they caught up with Aunt Fareedaâ€”now loaded with packages and looking triumphant from her successful hagglingâ€”Areeba had settled into a pattern of constant, quiet conversation with herself that would have been concerning if it wasn't so obviously making her happy.

"You're in a good mood," Aunt Fareeda observed as they walked to their next destination. "I'm glad. You had us so worried with all that fainting."

"I'm feeling much better now," Areeba said. Then, to herself, quiet enough that only Ayesha heard: "Better than ever, actually. Yes, I know, you're very pleased with yourself. Oh, shut up."

She was smiling as she said it.

They met the rest of the family at a restaurant for lunchâ€”a small place that served the best daal chawal Ayesha had ever tasted. The family crowded around tables pushed together, sharing dishes and stories from their morning shopping.

Uncle Jamil showed off a new knife he'd bought. Aunt Sadia displayed the toys she'd gotten for the children. Everyone talked over each other in the comfortable chaos of a large family meal.

And through it all, Areeba sat with a small, secret smile, occasionally tilting her head to listen to something no one else could hear, her lips moving silently in response.

Uncle Tariq noticed. "Areeba, are you feeling alright? You keep talking to yourself."

"Just thinking out loud," Areeba said quickly. "Bad habit."

"You've been doing it a lot," Faizan observed. "Like, constantly. It's kind of weird."

"Artists are weird," Aunt Fareeda said, coming to Areeba's defense. "She's probably composing poetry or something. Leave her alone."

The family accepted this explanation because it was easier than questioning it. Because Areeba seemed happy. Because the alternativeâ€”that something was genuinely wrongâ€”would require action they didn't know how to take.

So they ignored it. Chose not to see what was right in front of them.

And Areeba continued her quiet conversation with the entity sharing her body, in a bazaar in Naran, surrounded by family who loved her but couldn't save her.

Because she didn't want to be saved.

After lunch, as they walked back through the bazaar toward the hotel, Ayesha fell into step beside her sister.

"They're starting to notice," she said quietly.

"I know," Areeba replied. "We're getting sloppy. Too comfortable."

"Are you going to try to hide it better?"

Areeba was quiet for a moment, her expression distant. Having an internal conversation, Ayesha realized. Consulting with Faisal.

Finally, she spoke. "We'll try. But honestly? I'm not sure we can. Or want to. This is who we are now. Both of us. Together." She looked at Ayesha with eyes that held both her sister and someone else. "I know you think this is wrong. Unnatural. But it's my life. My choice. And I choose this. I choose him."

The declaration was quiet but firm. Final.

And Ayesha realized, with a sinking feeling, that she'd lost. Whatever battle she'd been fighting to save her sister from possessionâ€”she'd lost.

Because you couldn't save someone who'd already decided they didn't need saving.

Ahead of them, the family walked in groups, laughing and chatting, blissfully unaware that the impossible walked among them.

And in a bazaar in Naran, under the watchful mountains, a girl and a ghost continued their dance of becoming one.

# CHAPTER 10: THE CHOICE

The next morning dawned gray and drizzly, as if the mountains themselves were mourning the family's departure. Ayesha woke to the sound of suitcases being zipped and bags being shuffled around Room 9.

"Can't believe the trip is already over," Aunt Sadia said, folding clothes with practiced efficiency. "Feels like we just got here."

"My back disagrees," Aunt Fareeda replied, stretching with a wince. "My back says we've been climbing mountains for a year."

Areeba sat on her bed, packing her things with unusual slowness. Her movements were careful, deliberate, like she was trying to memorize the act of folding each piece of clothing. Her expression was distant, melancholy.

Ayesha recognized the look. Areeba was talking to Faisal. And from the sadness in her eyes, it wasn't a happy conversation.

"You okay, beta?" Aunt Fareeda asked, noticing Areeba's mood. "You've been so quiet this morning."

"Just sad to leave," Areeba said, and her voice carried genuine emotion. "It's been... special here."

"We'll come back," Aunt Sadia assured her. "Maybe next summer. Make it a tradition."

Areeba's smile was bittersweet. "Maybe."

They finished packing and hauled their luggage downstairs. The lobby was chaotic with families checking out, bags piled everywhere, children running around burning off last-minute energy before the long bus ride back to Lahore.

Uncle Jamil was settling the bill at the front desk. Uncle Tariq was doing a headcount to make sure they hadn't lost any children. The male cousins were loading bags onto the same coaster bus that had brought them hereâ€”was it really only four days ago? It felt like a lifetime.

Ayesha watched Areeba standing slightly apart from the group, staring out at the mountains visible through the lobby windows. Her lips were moving in that now-familiar pattern of silent conversation.

"I don't want to leave either," Areeba whispered to the air. "I know. I know. We'll figure it out. I promise."

She reached out her hand, and for just a momentâ€”barely a flickerâ€”Faisal's translucent form appeared beside her, his ghostly hand touching hers. The image was there and gone so quickly Ayesha might have imagined it.

"Areeba!" Aunt Fareeda called. "Come help with these bags!"

Areeba turned away from the window, her expression smoothing into normalcy. She grabbed a bag and headed outside where the bus waited, its engine already rumbling.

The family loaded up in a controlled chaos of bags and bodies and last-minute bathroom runs. The hotel staff waved goodbye. The street vendors they'd gotten to know over the past few days called out safe journey wishes.

Finally, everyone was aboard. The driver closed the door with a hydraulic hiss, and the bus lurched into motion, leaving Lalazar Hotel behind.

Ayesha had ended up in a seat near the back, with Areeba beside her. The aunts were a few rows ahead. The male cousins were scattered throughout. Uncle Jamil sat up front, already dozing.

As the bus navigated through Naran Bazaar one last time, Areeba pressed her face to the window, watching the mountains disappear behind them with each turn of the road.

"You're really going to miss it," Ayesha observed quietly.

"It's where weâ€”" Areeba caught herself. "Where I figured things out. Where everything changed."

Where you fell in love with your possessor, Ayesha thought but didn't say.

The bus climbed out of the valley, retracing the route they'd taken days ago. Past Saif-ul-Malook's turnoff. Past the checkpoint. Down through the switchbacks that had terrified them on the way up but seemed almost tame now.

Areeba kept up a constant quiet murmurâ€”talking to Faisal, Ayesha knew. Making plans. Saying things she didn't want anyone else to hear.

They'd been traveling for about an hour when Aunt Fareeda turned around in her seat, looking back at Areeba.

"Beta, who is this Faisal you keep talking about?"

The question dropped into the bus like a stone into still water.

Areeba went white. Her mouth opened but no sound came out. Around them, other family members were turning, curious about the question.

"What?" Areeba finally managed, her voice strangled.

"Faisal," Aunt Fareeda repeated. "You keep saying that name. I've heard you several times over the past couple days. 'Faisal this' and 'Faisal that.' Who is he? A friend from university?"

Ayesha's heart hammered. This was it. The moment of exposure. There was no good answer to this question. No way to explainâ€”

"I am Faisal."

The words came from Areeba's mouth, but the voice was slightly different. Deeper. Masculine. Faisal had taken control.

Every head in the nearby seats turned. Aunt Fareeda's eyebrows shot up. "You are?"

Faisal opened his mouthâ€”Areeba's mouthâ€”and Ayesha could see the panic in her eyes even as he controlled the body. He had no idea what to say. He'd just bought them seconds, not a solution.

Then Areeba pushed forward, taking control back mid-sentence.

"â€”means I am writing a story!" The words tumbled out in a rush. "About myself. A fictionalized version. And in that story, I... I made myself a male character. Named Faisal. For fun. To see the world from a different perspective."

She was breathing hard from the effort of the lie and the rapid switch of control. In Ayesha's mind, she could almost hear the conversation happening at lightning speed inside Areeba's head.

*That was close.*

*I panicked. Sorry.*

*It's okay. Was that believable?*

*I don't know. Keep going.*

"A story?" Aunt Sadia had turned around now too, intrigued. "Like a novel?"

"More like... creative writing. An exercise." Areeba's hands twisted in her lap. "My professor assigned it. Write about yourself but change your gender and see how it affects your perspective on events. So I've been... narrating the trip. In my head. As Faisal. That's why you heard me saying the name."

The lie was elaborate enough to be believable. Specific enough to sound real. And exactly the kind of artsy thing a university student might be assigned.

Ayesha held her breath.

Aunt Fareeda considered this. "That's... actually quite interesting. What's it like? Being a boy in your story?"

"Different," Areeba said, which was probably the truest thing she'd said all morning. "Very different. Liberating in some ways. Confusing in others. It's made me think about things I wouldn't normally think about."

"Like what?" Aunt Sadia asked, genuinely curious now.

Areeba glanced at Ayeshaâ€”a quick, panicked lookâ€”before answering. "Like how differently people treat you based on gender. How much more physical freedom men have. How different the internal dialogue is when you're not constantly worried about safety and propriety and what people think."

"Hmm." Aunt Fareeda nodded thoughtfully. "You'll have to let us read it when you're done."

"It's not very good," Areeba said quickly. "Just an exercise. Very rough."

"Still. I'd be interested." Aunt Fareeda smiled and turned back around in her seat.

The moment passed. The crisis averted. Around them, the bus rumbled on, other passengers returning to their own conversations and activities.

Ayesha leaned close to Areeba and whispered, "Nice cover."

"Faisal said that too," Areeba whispered back, then caught herself. "Sorry. Habit."

"You're going to slip up eventually. You know that, right?"

"I know." Areeba's voice was barely audible. "We're working on it."

They rode in silence for a while, watching the landscape change as they descendedâ€”the barren peaks giving way to pine forests, the pine forests to rocky hills, the hills to the beginnings of the plains.

"Areeba," Ayesha said quietly, "can we talk? Really talk?"

"Okay."

"In the bathroom. More private."

They waited until the bus made its first rest stopâ€”the same gas station where Areeba had fainted days ago. Ayesha's stomach twisted at the memory. This was where it had all started. Where Faisal had taken control for the second time.

While the family scattered to use facilities and stretch their legs, Ayesha grabbed Areeba's arm and pulled her toward the women's restroom. It was as grimy and unpleasant as before, but it was private.

"We need to talk about what happens when we get back to Lahore," Ayesha said without preamble.

Areeba leaned against the sink, her expression guarded. "I know."

"You can't keep this up. Not at home. Not around more people, not with our parents, not at universityâ€”"

"I know," Areeba repeated.

"So you have to leave him." The words came out harder than Ayesha intended. "Faisal. You have to make him go. Before we get back. While you're still strong enough to push him out."

Areeba's expression didn't change. She just stared at Ayesha with eyes that held both her sister and someone else.

"You have to separate," Ayesha pressed. "Find a way. Ask him to leave. Force him if you have to. But this can't continueâ€”"

"No."

The word was quiet but absolute.

"Areebaâ€”"

"No," Areeba repeated, louder now. "I'm not leaving him. He's coming with me. Back to Lahore. Back to my life. All of it."

"You can't be seriousâ€”"

"I'm completely serious." Areeba straightened, and for the first time since this conversation started, she looked Ayesha directly in the eyes. "He's part of me now. I'm not giving that up."

"He's possessing you!"

"He's partnering with me," Areeba corrected. "There's a difference. And I choose this. I choose him."

Ayesha felt desperation rising in her chest. "Think about what you're saying! You're choosing to share your body, your life, your entire existence with a spirit we know nothing about! We don't know what he is, where he came from, what he wantsâ€”"

"I know what he wants," Areeba said softly. "He wants to live. To experience the world. To not be alone in the darkness anymore. And I want to help him. I want him with me."

"Why?" The question came out almost as a plea. "Why would you want this?"

Areeba was quiet for a long moment. When she spoke, her voice was gentle, patient, like she was explaining something to a child.

"Because he understands me. Because he makes me brave. Because when I'm scared, he's strong. When he's lonely, I'm there. We complete each other in a way I can't explain. And yes, I know how that sounds. I know it's not normal. But it's real. It's mine. And I'm not giving it up."

"Our parentsâ€”"

"Won't know. We'll be careful. More careful than we've been here."

"Your friendsâ€”"

"Don't know me like he does anyway."

"Your futureâ€”"

"Is mine to decide!" Areeba's voice rose, echoing off the bathroom tiles. She took a breath, calming herself. "Ayesha. I love you. You're my sister in every way that matters. But this is my choice. My life. My body. And I'm choosing to share it with Faisal. Permanently."

The finality in her voice was unmistakable. This wasn't a decision she was still wrestling with. This was done. Decided. Final.

Ayesha felt tears prick her eyes. "I'm losing you."

"No." Areeba stepped forward and took Ayesha's hands. Her grip was warm, solid, real. "You're not losing me. I'm still here. I'm still your favorite, your sister, your friend. I'm just... more now. We're more. And I need you to accept that. To accept us."

"And if I can't?" Ayesha's voice broke. "If I think this is wrong and dangerous and I need to tell someone?"

Areeba's expression hardened slightly. "Then I'll deny it. I'll say I'm fine. That you're imagining things. That the altitude sickness affected you more than it affected me. And they'll believe me because I'll seem normal and you'll seem paranoid." She squeezed Ayesha's hands. "Please don't make me do that. Please don't make me choose between you and him."

"You already have chosen," Ayesha whispered. "You chose him."

"I'm choosing both of you," Areeba corrected. "If you'll let me. Ayesha, please. I need you in my life. But I need him too. Can you accept that? Can you keep our secret and still be my sister?"

The bathroom door banged open, making them both jump. Little Hiba ran in, saw them, and ran back out. "They're in here!" she called to someone.

"We need to get back on the bus," Areeba said quietly, still holding Ayesha's hands. "So I need an answer. Are you with us? Or against us?"

Ayesha looked at her sister, at the determination in her eyes, the set of her jaw, the way she stood like someone ready to fight for what she loved. This wasn't the uncertain, anxious Areeba who'd boarded the bus in Lahore days ago.

This was someone new. Someone stronger. Someone who'd found power in the strangest, most impossible place.

And despite everythingâ€”despite the wrongness of it, the danger, the absolute insanityâ€”Ayesha couldn't bring herself to destroy that.

"I won't tell," she finally said. "I won't support this. I won't say it's okay or good or right. But I won't tell."

Relief flooded Areeba's face. "Thank you. Thank you, Ayesha. I promise you won't regretâ€”"

"I already regret it," Ayesha cut her off, pulling her hands free. "But you're right. It's your choice. Your body. Your life. So I'll keep your secret. Both of your secrets."

She turned and walked out of the bathroom before Areeba could respond. Before she could change her mind. Before the tears that threatened could actually fall.

Outside, the family was loading back onto the bus. Uncle Jamil was doing another headcount. The driver was checking something on his phone.

Ayesha climbed aboard and took her seat, staring resolutely out the window.

A moment later, Areeba slid into the seat beside her.

"Ayeshaâ€”"

"I don't want to talk about it anymore," Ayesha said, her voice flat. "You made your choice. I'll keep your secret. That's all there is to say."

Areeba was quiet for a long moment. Then, so softly Ayesha almost didn't hear it: "He says thank you too. For keeping us safe."

Ayesha closed her eyes and didn't respond.

The bus rumbled to life and pulled back onto the highway, leaving the mountains behind. Leaving Naran behind. Carrying them back toward Lahore, toward normal life, toward the impossible task of hiding the supernatural in the mundane.

In the seat beside Ayesha, Areeba resumed her quiet conversation with the spirit sharing her body. Making plans. Discussing strategies for hiding in plain sight. Two beings learning to navigate the world as one.

And Ayesha stared out the window and wondered if her silence made her complicit. If by choosing not to tell, she was choosing to enable something that might destroy them all.

But what choice did she have? Tell the family and lose her sister's trust forever? Watch them try to "fix" Areeba, maybe hurt her in the process? Risk Faisal becoming dangerous if cornered?

No. The only choice was to watch. To wait. To be ready to act ifâ€”whenâ€”things went wrong.

Because they would go wrong. Ayesha was certain of it.

Things this impossible, this unnatural, always went wrong eventually.

The bus drove on through the afternoon, carrying its passengers away from the mountains where the veil between worlds grew thin, back toward the city where impossible things couldn't happen.

Except they had happened.

And they were coming home.

# CHAPTER 11: NORMAL LIFE (ABNORMALLY LIVED)

Three days had passed since they'd returned to Lahore.

Three days of trying to pretend everything was normal. Three days of watching Areeba navigate life with a constant companion no one else could see. Three days of Ayesha keeping a secret that felt heavier with each passing hour.

Monday morning arrived with Lahore's typical chaosâ€”traffic jams, honking rickshaws, the smell of exhaust mixing with street food. Ayesha and Areeba sat in the back of Farrukh's was about to about to drove them to NUST, the same route they'd taken hundreds of times before.

Except everything was different now.

"You have your assignment?" Faiza asked from the front seat, twisting around to look at Areeba. "The structures one that's due today?"

"Yes, Mama," Areeba said, patting her bag.

"And you studied for the quiz?"

"Yes, Mama."

"And you're feeling completely recovered? No more altitude sickness symptoms?"

"I'm fine, Mama. Really."

Faiza studied her daughter for a moment longer, then nodded. "You do look better. More color in your cheeks. The mountain air must have done you good."

*If only you knew what else the mountains did*, Ayesha thought darkly.

Areeba caught her eye and gave a small, guilty smile. Ayesha looked away.

The truth was, Areeba *did* look better. Healthier. More vibrant. Since making her decision to keep Faisal, she'd stopped looking haunted and started looking... alive. Energized. Like someone who'd found purpose.

It made Ayesha's stomach twist. Wrong things weren't supposed to make people look healthy.

Farrukh pulled up to the university gates. "Have a good day, girls. I'll pick you up at four."

They grabbed their bags and headed into campus, joining the stream of students flowing toward various departments. NUST's main campus was a sprawling complex of modern buildings, meticulously maintained lawns, and perpetually crowded walkways.

"You're still not talking to me," Areeba observed as they walked toward the Civil Engineering building.

"I'm talking to you."

"You're using words in my direction. That's not the same thing."

Ayesha adjusted her dupatta and kept walking. "What do you want me to say? 'Congratulations on your supernatural parasite?'"

"He's not a parasite." Areeba's voice had an edge. "And you said you wouldn'tâ€”"

"I said I wouldn't *tell*," Ayesha interrupted. "I didn't say I'd be happy about it."

They walked in tense silence for a few moments. Then Areeba spoke again, quieter. "He heard that. The parasite comment. It hurt his feelings."

"He's dead. He doesn't have feelings."

"Yes, he does. And that hurt too."

Ayesha stopped walking and turned to face her sister. Students flowed around them like water around stones. "Areeba, I'm trying. I really am. But this isâ€”it's too much. It's too weird. And now we're back in real life with real people and real consequences, and I'm terrified every second that someone's going to noticeâ€”"

"No one will notice," Areeba said firmly. "We're being careful. Watch."

She raised her voice to normal volume and waved at a girl passing by. "Sana! Hi!"

Sana, one of their classmates, stopped and smiled. "Hey! How was your trip? I saw your Instagram storiesâ€”those mountains looked amazing!"

"It was incredible," Areeba said, and her voice was perfectly normal. Perfectly *her*. "You should go sometime. The lake is unreal."

"Maybe next summer. Hey, did you finish the assignment? I struggled with question three."

"Oh, the moment distribution one? Yeah, I figured it out. I can show you before class if you want."

"You're a lifesaver! Walk with me?"

Areeba glanced at Ayesha, who made a small gestureâ€”*go ahead*. Areeba fell into step with Sana, chatting about the assignment with easy familiarity.

Ayesha followed a few steps behind, watching. Looking for signs. For slips. For anything that might give away the impossible truth.

But there was nothing. Areeba was just... Areeba. Maybe a little more confident in her stride. Maybe a little quicker with her smile. But nothing that would make anyone suspicious.

Maybe this could actually work.

Or maybe they were all just waiting for the other shoe to drop.

---

Their first class was Structural Analysis III with Dr. Raza, a notoriously difficult professor who took pleasure in cold-calling students and watching them squirm. The lecture hall was already half-full when they arrived, students scattered across the tiered seating.

Ayesha headed for their usual spotâ€”middle section, three rows from the back, close enough to see but far enough to avoid constant attention. Areeba followed, with Sana still chattering beside her about the weekend.

They settled into their seats. Ayesha pulled out her notebook and pencil case with methodical precision, trying to focus on the familiar ritual of preparing for class. Normal things. Normal actions.

Areeba sat beside her, arranging her own materials. To anyone watching, she looked like any other student. But Ayesha noticed the small thingsâ€”the way Areeba's lips moved slightly, like she was talking under her breath. The way her eyes would focus on empty air beside her, then refocus on her notebook. The small smile that crossed her face at random moments.

She was talking to him. Constantly. An ongoing conversation no one else could hear.

"Does he ever shut up?" Ayesha whispered.

Areeba blinked, coming back to external reality. "What?"

"Faisal. Does he ever just... not talk?"

"Sometimes. When I'm talking to other people, he usually stays quiet. Listens." Areeba paused. "He says you're grumpy today."

"I'm grumpy every day lately. Tell him he's welcome for the mood."

"He also saysâ€”" Areeba stopped herself, shaking her head. "Never mind."

"What?"

"He says he's sorry. For making things complicated. But he's not sorry enough to leave."

Ayesha opened her mouth to respond, but Dr. Raza strode into the lecture hall at that moment, cutting off all conversation. The professor was a small, sharp-eyed man in his fifties who wore his authority like armor.

"Good morning," he said, though his tone suggested the morning was anything but good. "I hope you all completed the reading on indeterminate structures. Because we're going to need that foundation for today's material."

He turned to the board and began writing equations in rapid, cramped handwriting. "Today we're discussing the moment distribution method for analyzing continuous beams. Who can tell me the fundamental principle behind this method?"

Silence. The students had learned early that volunteering in Dr. Raza's class was dangerousâ€”he'd pick apart your answer even if it was correct.

Dr. Raza turned, surveying the room with predatory patience. "No one? Really? This was in the assigned reading."

More silence.

"Fine. Miss..." His eyes landed on someone in the front row. "Khadija. Fundamental principle. Go."

Khadija stammered through a partially correct answer. Dr. Raza listened with visible impatience, then cut her off mid-sentence.

"Close, but imprecise. The principle is that moments are distributed to connected members based on their relative stiffnesses until equilibrium is achieved. Who can tell me how we calculate the distribution factor?"

Again, silence.

This time, Areeba's hand went up.

Ayesha's head whipped around to stare at her sister. Areeba *never* volunteered. She was a decent studentâ€”solid B's and occasional A'sâ€”but she preferred to stay under the radar, especially in Dr. Raza's class.

Dr. Raza looked surprised too. "Miss... Areeba, isn't it? Go ahead."

"The distribution factor is calculated by dividing the stiffness of the member by the sum of stiffnesses of all members meeting at that joint," Areeba said clearly. "It's essentially the ratio of how much moment that particular member will absorb compared to the others."

Dr. Raza's eyebrows rose slightly. "Correct. And how does this relate to the carry-over factor?"

Without hesitation: "The carry-over factor is the proportion of the distributed moment that gets transmitted to the far end of the member. For a prismatic member with a fixed far end, it's typically one-half. For a pinned end, it's zero since pins can't resist moment."

"Very good. And what aboutâ€”"

"If I may, sir," Areeba interruptedâ€”another thing she never didâ€”"the real elegance of the moment distribution method is that it's iterative. Each cycle of distribution and carry-over brings you closer to the true solution. It's particularly useful for complex frames where the force method would be computationally intensive."

The lecture hall had gone very quiet. Students were turning to look at Areeba, surprised by the sudden display of knowledge.

Dr. Raza was studying her with new interest. "You seem well-versed in this topic, Miss Areeba."

"I find the methodology intuitive," Areeba said. Then she added, almost absently, "When you think about buildings as living systems, the way forces flow through them makes more sense. Each member in dialogue with the others, finding balance together."

*Buildings as living systems.* That wasn't textbook language. That was... architectural language.

Ayesha's eyes widened. *Faisal.*

"An interesting perspective," Dr. Raza said. "Tell me, what are the limitations of the moment distribution method?"

"It's best suited for beams and frames under fixed loading," Areeba replied immediately. "For moving loads or dynamic analysis, you'd need other approaches. And while it's elegant for hand calculations, it's less efficient than matrix methods for computer analysis. Though personally, I think there's value in the hand calculation processâ€”it builds intuition about structural behavior that you lose when you just plug numbers into software."

Dr. Raza actually smiled. It was a small smile, but on his usually stern face, it was significant. "I couldn't agree more. Too many students these days rely entirely on SAP2000 without understanding the underlying principles."

He turned back to the board and continued the lecture, but he kept directing questions to Areeba throughout. And she answered every single one perfectly, often elaborating with insights that went beyond the textbook.

Around them, students were whispering.

"Since when is Areeba so good at this?"

"She's never been this sharp before..."

"Maybe she actually studied for once."

In the row ahead of them, a guy turned aroundâ€” Rizwan, one of the top students in their class. He was conventionally handsome, always well-dressed, and generally considered a good catch by most of the female students.

"That was impressive," he said to Areeba when Dr. Raza paused to draw a diagram. "I didn't know you were so into structural theory."

Areeba smiled politely. "I've been doing extra reading."

"Clearly. Hey, a few of us are forming a study group for the final project. We could use someone with your understanding ofâ€”"

"No."

The word came out harder than Areeba's usual speaking voice. Sharper. Almost masculine.

Rizwan blinked. "Oh. Okay, no pressure. I just thoughtâ€”"

"She said no." Areeba's voice was definitely different nowâ€”lower pitched, with an edge that made Rizwan lean back slightly. "She's not interested in your study group. Or your company. So you can turn back around and focus on the lecture."

Ayesha grabbed Areeba's arm under the desk, squeezing hard. *Faisal. That was Faisal.*

Rizwan's expression shifted from friendly to confused to offended. "I was just asking about studying, notâ€”whatever you thinkâ€”"

"Rizwan," Dr. Raza's voice cut across the room. "Is there a problem?"

"No, sir," Rizwan said quickly, turning back around. But his shoulders were tense, and he threw one more confused glance at Areeba before facing forward.

Beside Ayesha, Areeba's posture shifted slightlyâ€”less rigid, more natural. When she spoke, her whisper was back to her normal voice. "Sorry. He got... protective."

"*Protective?*" Ayesha hissed. "That was jealous! That was possessive! Areeba, he can't justâ€”"

"I know. I told him. He's sorry."

"I don't care if he's sorry! You can't let him take over whenever a guy talks to you! That'sâ€”people will notice!"

"It won't happen again," Areeba whispered, but she didn't sound entirely convinced.

In front of them, Rizwan was still radiating confusion and hurt feelings. Around them, several students were shooting curious looks at Areeba.

*This is how it starts*, Ayesha thought grimly. *This is how people begin to notice something's wrong.*

Dr. Raza finished the lecture and assigned homeworkâ€”three complex frame analysis problems using moment distribution. As students packed up their things, Ayesha noticed several people watching Areeba with new interest.

Sana leaned over. "Girl, what was *that* about? You totally shut down Rizwan."

"He caught me off guard," Areeba said, her voice carefully neutral. "I'm not good with being put on the spot."

"He was just asking about studying together."

"I prefer to study alone."

"Since when? We literally studied together last weekâ€”"

"I mean for the final project. I work better independently on big things." Areeba was recovering, smoothing over the strangeness with reasonable explanations. "And I didn't mean to sound harsh. Can you tell him I'm sorry if I was rude?"

"Tell him yourself," Sana said, but not unkindly. "Come on, we have Materials next."

They gathered their things and filed out of the lecture hall. In the corridor, Ayesha pulled Areeba aside while other students flowed past them.

"We need to talk about what just happened."

"I know."

"He can't do that. He can't just take over because he doesn't like a guy talking to you."

"I *know*." Areeba looked frustrated. "We're still figuring out the boundaries. It's only been a few daysâ€”"

"You don't have the luxury of figuring it out slowly," Ayesha interrupted. "Every time he does something like that, it's another person who might notice something's off. Another crack in your cover."

"I'll talk to him. Set clearer rules."

"Can you even do that? Can you control when he takes over?"

Areeba hesitated. "Mostly. If I'm aware and pushing back, I can stop him. But when I'm distracted or if he feels strongly about something, it's harder."

"So basically, any time he gets jealous, he can just hijack your body."

"It's notâ€”" Areeba stopped, took a breath. "It's more complicated than that. We're learning to communicate better. To ask before taking control instead of just doing it. But yes, strong emotions make it harder for both of us to maintain boundaries."

Ayesha rubbed her temples, feeling a headache forming. "This is insane. You know that, right? This whole situation is completely insane."

"I know." Areeba's voice was small. "But it's my insane situation. And I'm making it work."

"Are you? Because from where I'm standing, you almost just blew your cover in front of thirty people."

Before Areeba could respond, Rizwan appeared from around a corner, clearly having waited for them. He approached cautiously, like someone approaching a potentially aggressive animal.

"Hey, Areeba. Can I talk to you for a second?"

Areeba's entire body tensed. Ayesha could see itâ€”the subtle shift in posture, the way her shoulders squared, the slight tilt of her chin. Faisal, getting ready to defend his territory.

"Areeba," Ayesha said quietly, urgently. "Stay with me. Don't let himâ€”"

"I've got it," Areeba whispered back. Then, to Rizwan, in a carefully controlled normal voice: "Sure. What's up?"

"I just wanted to apologize if I made you uncomfortable," Rizwan said. "I wasn't trying toâ€”I mean, I just thought since you seemed really knowledgeable, you'd be a good addition to the study group. That's all. I wasn't trying to hit on you or anything."

Ayesha watched Areeba's face carefully. She could see the micro-expressions shiftingâ€”Areeba's natural empathy and politeness fighting with Faisal's territorial instincts.

"It's okay," Areeba finally said, and her voice was her own. "I overreacted. I'm sorry for being harsh. It's been a weird morning."

"No worries." Rizwan smiled, relieved. "So, about the study groupâ€”no pressure, but the offer stands if you change your mind. It's me, Bilal, Zara, and Amna. We're meeting Wednesday evenings at the library."

Ayesha saw Areeba's jaw clench slightlyâ€”Faisal, pushing to say no. But Areeba maintained control.

"Thanks for the offer. I'll think about it."

"Cool." Rizwan nodded and headed off to his next class.

As soon as he was out of earshot, Areeba let out a long breath. "That was harder than it should have been."

"He wanted you to shut him down again."

"Yes. He's very..." Areeba searched for the word. "Insistent. About other guys."

"Areeba, that's not romantic. That's a red flag. That's controlling behaviorâ€”"

"It's protectiveâ€”"

"It's possessive," Ayesha corrected firmly. "And you need to establish right now that he doesn't get to control who you talk to or how you interact with people. Because that's not partnership. That's him using you."

Areeba's expression shuttered. "You don't understand what we have."

"I understand that a jealous spirit is controlling your body against your will."

"It's not against my willâ€”"

"Then why did you have to fight to stay in control just now?" Ayesha demanded. "Why was it 'harder than it should have been' to simply have a polite conversation?"

Areeba didn't answer. Around them, the corridor was emptying as students headed to their next classes.

"We're going to be late for Materials," Areeba finally said, deflecting.

"Areebaâ€”"

"Please, Ayesha. Just... not now. Okay?" There was exhaustion in her voice. "I'll talk to him. I promise. We'll set better boundaries. But I can't do this right now. I need to get through the day first."

Ayesha wanted to push. Wanted to drag her sister somewhere private and have it outâ€”force her to see the danger she was in. But the defeated slump of Areeba's shoulders stopped her.

"Fine," Ayesha said. "But we're talking tonight. Really talking. About rules and boundaries and what happens if he can't control his jealousy."

"Okay."

They hurried to their next class, sliding into seats just as the professor began. Materials Science was normally one of Areeba's better subjects, but today she seemed distracted, her attention split between the lecture and her internal conversation.

Ayesha watched her sister throughout the class. Watched the small movements of her lips. The distant look that would cross her face. The small smiles at invisible jokes.

Two people sharing one body.

And Ayesha was the only one who knew.

The only one who could see the cracks forming.

The only one who could stop this before it spiraled completely out of control.

But watching Areebaâ€”seeing the way she'd light up during those internal conversations, the confidence that seemed to flow through her when Faisal was helping her, the way she looked more *alive* than she had in yearsâ€”Ayesha had to confront an uncomfortable truth.

Areeba was happy.

Wrong, impossible, supernatural situation asideâ€”Areeba was genuinely happy.

And what kind of person would Ayesha be if she destroyed that?

Even if she was certain that eventually, inevitably, it would destroy Areeba first?

# CHAPTER 12: ABNORMALLY LIVED Again

The rest of the morning passed without major incident. Areeba was more careful, keeping her answers in class just good enough to avoid attention but not so brilliant as to raise eyebrows. Faisal, it seemed, had gotten the message about being subtle.

At lunch, they headed to the cafeteria with Sana and a few other girls from their class. The cafeteria was its usual chaosâ€”long lines, crowded tables, the smell of biryani and samosas mixing with too many bodies in too small a space.

They managed to snag a table near the windows. Ayesha was picking at her chicken roll when she noticed Areeba had gone still, her eyes tracking something across the cafeteria.

"What?" Ayesha asked.

"Nothing," Areeba said, but her voice had that faraway quality that meant she was talking to Faisal.

Ayesha followed her gaze and saw a group of girls from the Architecture department sitting a few tables over. They were animated, laughing, one of them gesturing dramatically while telling a story.

"He's watching them," Ayesha said quietly. "Isn't he?"

Areeba's lips quirked in a small smile. "He says the one in the blue dupatta has excellent posture. Very elegant. And the one with the braid has beautiful handsâ€”artistic hands, he says. Perfect for drafting."

Ayesha blinked. "Is he... is he checking out other girls? While in *your* body?"

Areeba's smile widened, but there was a tightness around her eyes. "He's an architect. He appreciates aesthetics. It's professional observation."

"Professional observation," Ayesha repeated flatly.

"That's what he says." But Areeba's jaw was clenched now, her fingers gripping her water bottle a little too hard.

"You're jealous," Ayesha realized. "Oh my God, you're actually jealous."

"I'm notâ€”" Areeba stopped herself. "Maybe a little. It's weird, okay? He gets possessive when guys look at me, but then he can just casually comment on other girls?"

"Did you tell him that?"

Areeba's expression flickeredâ€”internal conversation happening at lightning speed. Then her face smoothed into something that wasn't quite her expression. When she spoke, the voice was Faisal's.

"I was merely appreciating the aestheticâ€”" But the words cut off abruptly as Areeba clearly wrestled back control.

"Don't you dare try to justify it," Areeba hissed under her breath. "You practically snapped Rizwan's head off for being friendly, and now you'reâ€”what? Rating girls in the cafeteria?"

Sana looked up from her food. "Who are you talking to?"

"Myself," Areeba said quickly, too quickly. "Just... thinking out loud. About the assignment."

"The assignment makes you angry?" Sana looked confused.

"It's frustrating," Areeba improvised, but her attention was still split, still arguing with someone no one else could see.

Under the table, Ayesha kicked her sister's ankle. Hard.

Areeba yelped, refocusing on the external world. "Ow! Whatâ€”"

"You're doing it again," Ayesha said pointedly. "The thing we talked about. About being careful?"

Realization dawned on Areeba's face. She glanced around the tableâ€”Sana and two other girls were all watching her with varying degrees of concern and curiosity.

"Sorry," Areeba said, forcing a laugh. "I'm just really tired. Didn't sleep well. Makes me spacey."

"You should go to bed earlier," Sana advised. "My sister gets like this when she's sleep-deprived. Starts talking to herself and everything."

"Yeah. I'll do that."

But under her breath, so quiet only Ayesha could hear: "We're not done discussing this."

The whispered response only Areeba could hear must have been something provocative, because her cheeks flushed pink and her eyes widened slightly.

"Faisal!" she hissed.

Ayesha closed her eyes. "I don't even want to know."

"He's beingâ€”" Areeba cut herself off, clearly having an entire argument in the space of seconds. Her expressions shifted rapidlyâ€”annoyed, embarrassed, reluctantly amused, then annoyed again.

"You two are going to screw this up," Ayesha muttered. "You lovebirds are going to get so caught up in your jealous little spats that someone's going to notice you're literally arguing with yourself in public."

"We're notâ€”lovebirds?" Areeba's voice went up at the end, half-denial, half-question.

"Please. You're fighting like a couple who've been married for twenty years. 'Oh, you can look at other girls but I can't talk to other guys?' This is relationship drama, Areeba. Relationship drama with a ghost who happens to live in your head."

"He's right here, you know," Areeba said defensively. "He can hear you."

"Good." Ayesha raised her voice slightly, still keeping it low enough that their tablemates wouldn't hear. "Faisal, listen carefully. If you want this arrangement to work, you both need to stop acting like possessive teenagers. No jealousy. No taking over to scare off guys. No commenting on other girls while your *host* is sitting right there. Got it?"

Areeba was quiet for a moment, then her expression shifted and Faisal's voice emerged: "You're right. I apologize. To both of you. This is... new. For both of us. Learning to be together like this. I sometimes forget that what I feel affects her, and what she feels affects me. It'sâ€”"

"Complicated," Ayesha finished. "Yeah. I got that. But complicated or not, you need to figure it out fast. Before someone notices that Areeba is having full conversations with thin air and starts asking questions neither of you can answer."

Areeba's expression shifted back. "He says he understands. We'll be more careful."

"You better be." Ayesha took a bite of her roll, chewing with more force than necessary. "Because I meant what I said. You two lovebirds are one slip away from disaster."

"Stop calling us that," Areeba muttered, but her cheeks were still pink.

"Are you blushing?" Sana asked, leaning forward with interest. "Who are you texting? Is there a guy?"

"What? No!" Areeba's voice went high with panic. "There's no guy!"

"Then why are you all red and flustered?"

"I'm notâ€”it's just hot in hereâ€”"

"It's literally air-conditioned," Sana pointed out. She grinned, delighted by this new development. "There's totally a guy. Come on, spill. Who is he?"

Ayesha watched Areeba squirm, trying to come up with a plausible denial. This was exactly the kind of attention they couldn't afford. But what could Areeba say? *Actually, I'm blushing because the ghost possessing me just said something flirtatious and I don't know how to feel about it?*

"His name is Faisal," Ayesha heard herself say.

Both Areeba and Sana's heads whipped toward her.

"What?" Areeba's eyes were wide with panic.

Ayesha kept her voice casual, like she was sharing harmless gossip. "That guy from the mountains. Remember? The one you were talking about on the bus?"

Understanding flooded Areeba's face. The creative writing assignment story. The fictional male version of herself.

"Oh. Right. That." Areeba latched onto the lifeline. "But he's not real. I mean, he's fiction. The writing exercise I mentioned."

"But you talk about him like he's real," Ayesha continued, warming to the cover story. "I swear, half the time I don't know if you're writing about this character or if you actually met someone in Naran."

"It's for the assignment!" Areeba insisted, but she was smiling now, playing along. "I'm just really into the character development. Getting into his head. That's all."

"Uh-huh." Sana looked between them, skeptical but amused. "Well, fictional or not, he's making you blush. Must be some character."

"He has his moments," Areeba said softly, and Ayesha knew she wasn't talking about a fictional character anymore.

The conversation moved onâ€”Sana started complaining about her Hydraulics professor, and the other girls joined in with their own grievances. But Ayesha kept watching Areeba, watching the small smile that lingered on her face, the way her eyes would occasionally go distant as she listened to something only she could hear.

Lovebirds.

The word had been meant as a criticism, a warning. But watching Areeba now, Ayesha had to acknowledge it might also be accurate.

Whatever was happening between Areeba and Faisalâ€”possession, partnership, or something else entirelyâ€”there was affection there. Real affection. Maybe even love, in whatever strange form love could take between the living and the dead.

Which made it simultaneously more beautiful and more dangerous.

Because love made people stupid. Made them take risks they shouldn't take. Made them overlook red flags and ignore warning signs.

And Areeba was already ignoring plenty of both.

---

The rest of the day passed in a strange tension. Areeba continued to excel in ways that were just noticeable enough to draw attentionâ€”answering questions with unusual confidence, offering insights that seemed beyond her normal expertise.

In their Surveying lab, she helped three different groups troubleshoot their theodolite readings, explaining the corrections needed with the patience of someone who'd done this hundreds of times.

"Since when are you so good with instruments?" asked Ahmed, one of their lab partners.

"I've been practicing," Areeba replied smoothly.

But Ayesha noticed the faraway look in her eyes. Noticed the way she moved with unusual precision, like someone else was guiding her hands.

By the time Farrukh picked them up at four o'clock, Ayesha was exhausted from watching. From analyzing every word, every gesture, every interaction for signs that someone might notice the truth.

"How was your day, girls?" Farrukh asked as they climbed into the car.

"Good, Baba" Areeba and Ayesha said. Areeba continued "Dr. Raza said I showed excellent understanding in Structural Analysis."

"Did he really?" Farrukh beamed with pride. "That's wonderful, beta! He's such a tough professor. You must have really impressed him."

"I had help," Areeba said quietly, and Ayesha knew she wasn't talking about tutoring.

At home, Faiza had dinner readyâ€”chicken karahi, fresh roti, and raita. The family ate together, Areeba's parents asking about their day, discussing weekend plans, mentioning that Aunt Sadia had invited them over on Friday.

Normal family conversation. Normal domestic life.

Except Ayesha kept watching Areeba, kept waiting for another slip. Another moment when Faisal's personality would bleed through too obviously.

But Areeba was perfectly herself. Laughing at her father's jokes. Helping her mother clear the table. Complaining about the amount of homework Dr. Raza had assigned.

If Ayesha didn't know better, she'd think everything was completely normal.

After dinner, Ayesha followed Areeba to her roomâ€”a space she'd been in countless times over the years. Posters of architectural landmarks on the walls. A desk buried under textbooks and sketches. A bulletin board covered with photos of family and friends.

Areeba closed the door and leaned against it, finally letting her careful mask drop. She looked tired.

"That was exhausting," she admitted.

"Which part? Hiding a possession or dealing with a jealous spirit?"

"Both. All of it." Areeba moved to her bed and sat down heavily. "Faisal says he's sorry about earlier. With Rizwan. He knows he overreacted."

"He needs to do more than be sorry," Ayesha said, settling into Areeba's desk chair. "He needs to not do it again. Ever."

"We've been talking about it. Setting rules." Areeba's eyes focused on empty air beside herâ€”where Faisal presumably stood or sat or however ghosts positioned themselves. "He gets that he can't just take over whenever he feels threatened. And I get that I need to be clearer about when he can have control and when he can't."

"This is so weird," Ayesha muttered.

"Tell me about it." Areeba gave a weak laugh. "Try being the one having the conversation."

"So what are these rules?"

Areeba was quiet for a moment, clearly listening to something Ayesha couldn't hear. Then: "He only takes control when I explicitly give permission or when there's an emergency. He doesn't interfere with my social interactions unless I ask for help. And if I tell him to back off, he backs off immediately. No arguments."

"Can he actually stick to that?"

"He says he will. And I believe him."

"Areeba, he's already proven he can't control his jealousyâ€”"

"He's also proven he can help me," Areeba interrupted. "Did you see how well I did today? I understood things I've struggled with all semester. I was confident. I was *good*. That's because of him. Because of what he knows."

"What exactly does he know?" Ayesha asked. "You said something about buildings as living systems. That's not engineering talk. That's architecture."

Areeba smiled, and there was pride in it. "He was an architect. When he was alive. He designed buildings. Beautiful ones, he says. And he remembers all of itâ€”the principles, the process, the way structures work. That's why he can help me with my classes. It's like having a personal tutor who lives in my head."

"When was he alive?"

Areeba's expression flickeredâ€”uncertain, almost evasive. "He doesn't remember exactly. A long time ago. Decades, maybe more. The memories are fuzzy."

"How convenient."

"Ayeshaâ€”"

"No, seriously. He remembers architecture but not when he died? He remembers structural principles but not his own history? That doesn't strike you as suspicious?"

"Memory fades after death," Areeba said defensively. "Especially when you spend yearsâ€”maybe centuriesâ€”alone in the dark. He's told me what he can remember. The rest is just... gone."

"Or he's lying."

Areeba's expression hardened. "He's not."

"How do you know?"

"Because I know him!" Areeba stood up, pacing now. "I know him the way you know someone you've spent every waking moment with. I hear his thoughts, feel his emotions, share his memories when he shows them to me. He's not lying. He's not manipulating me. He's just a person who died and got stuck and now has a chance to live again. And yes, he's possessive sometimes and yes, he struggles with boundaries, but so do living people. That doesn't make him evil."

"It makes him dangerous."

"Everything is dangerous!" Areeba's voice rose. "Crossing the street is dangerous! Flying on a plane is dangerous! But we do those things because the benefits outweigh the risks. And for me, being with Faisalâ€”learning from him, having him with meâ€”the benefits outweigh the risks."

"You can't possibly know thatâ€”"

"I know that before him, I was barely scraping by in my classes," Areeba said. "I know I was anxious all the time, second-guessing myself, feeling like I didn't belong in engineering. And now I feel capable. Confident. Like I actually understand what I'm doing. That's worth something. That's worth a lot."

Ayesha stood too, facing her sister across the small bedroom. "And when other people start noticing? When you go from average student to sudden genius and people ask questions? When Faisal's jealousy causes a scene you can't explain away? When mama, baba realize their daughter is speaking in two different voices? What then?"

"We'll be carefulâ€”"

"You were already not careful! Today, in front of everyone!"

"And I handled it!" Areeba shot back. "It was one slip. One moment. And I managed it. I'm learning, Ayesha. We both are. But I need you to have faith in me. Faith that I can make this work."

"I'm trying to protect you!"

"I don't need protection!" Areeba's eyes blazed. "I need support! I need my sister to trust that I know what I'm doing with my own life!"

"You're sharing your life with something we don't understand!"

"Someone! He's someone, not something!"

They stared at each other, both breathing hard, the argument hanging between them like smoke.

Finally, Ayesha broke the silence. "I can't do this. I can't watch this happen and pretend it's okay."

"Then don't watch," Areeba said coldly. "Go home. Leave me alone. I'll handle my own life."

"Areebaâ€”"

"I mean it. If you can't support me, if you're just going to constantly tell me how wrong this is, then I don't want you here. Faisal and I will figure it out on our own."

The words stung. Ayesha felt tears prick her eyes, but she refused to let them fall.

"Fine," she said quietly. "I'll go."

She grabbed her bag and headed for the door. Her hand was on the handle when Areeba's voice stopped her.

"Ayesha, wait."

Ayesha didn't turn around.

"I'm sorry." Areeba's voice was softer now, tired. "I shouldn't have said that. I do need you. I just... I need you to believe in me too."

Ayesha stood there for a long moment, hand on the door, decision balanced on a knife's edge.

Then she turned around.

"I believe that you believe this is right," she said carefully. "I believe you care about him. I believe you think you can control this. But Areeba, I also believe this is going to end badly. And when it does, I'll be here. Not to say I told you so. But to help pick up the pieces."

Areeba's expression softened. "Thank you."

"Don't thank me yet. We're not through this. We're barely at the beginning."

"I know."

Ayesha moved back into the room, settling into the desk chair again. The anger had drained out of both of them, leaving only exhaustion.

"Tell me about him," Ayesha said finally. "Not the architect stuff. Him. Who is he? What's he like?"

Areeba looked surprised by the question. Then a small smile crossed her face. "He's... thoughtful. Curious about everything. He asks a million questions about modern life because so much has changed since he was alive. He thinks cars are miraculous. He's fascinated by the internet. He spent twenty minutes yesterday just watching me scroll through Instagram, amazed that we can see pictures from anywhere in the world instantly."

"What else?"

"He's funny. Sarcastic. He makes commentary on everythingâ€”especially people-watching at university. He had very strong opinions about Rizwan's hairstyle." She paused. "He's also lonely. So lonely. When he talks about being trapped in the dark, before he found me, you can hear the desperation. The relief at finally having someone to talk to, something to experience. It's heartbreaking."

"So you're saving him."

"We're saving each other," Areeba corrected. "He gives me confidence and knowledge. I give him life and experience. It's symbiotic."

"Or parasitic."

"Ayesha."

"Sorry. Old habit." Ayesha ran a hand through her hair. "This is going to take me a while to accept. You know that, right?"

"I know. But you're trying. That's enough."

They sat in silence for a while. Outside, the sounds of Lahore evening filtered through the windowâ€”car horns, distant calls to prayer, the neighbor's TV playing too loud.

Normal life, continuing around them.

While inside this room, nothing was normal at all.

"Can I ask him something?" Ayesha said suddenly.

Areeba blinked. "Faisal? You want to talk to him?"

"If that's okay."

Areeba was quiet for a momentâ€”internal conversation. Then she nodded. "He says yes."

"Okay." Ayesha felt ridiculous, talking to empty air. But she directed her words to the space beside Areeba where Faisal presumably was. "If you hurt herâ€”if you take too much, or push too hard, or make her lose herselfâ€”I will find a way to get rid of you. I don't know how yet. But I will figure it out. Understand?"

Silence. Then Areeba's expression shifted slightly, and when she spoke, the voice was subtly differentâ€”deeper, more masculine, but still coming from Areeba's throat.

"I understand. And I give you my wordâ€”I will protect her. Always. She is the most precious thing in any world, living or dead. I would never harm her."

Despite everything, despite all her reservations, Ayesha believed him.

Which was either the best or worst thing that could have happened.

"Okay," Ayesha said. "Then we have an understanding."

Areeba's expression shifted back to normal. "He says thank you. For giving us a chance."

"Don't make me regret it."

"We won't."

Ayesha gathered her things for real this time, preparing to head home. At the door, she paused.

"Tomorrow, try to tone down the genius act. You were too noticeable today."

"I will. Faisal agreesâ€”we need to be more subtle."

"Good. And Areeba? Whatever happens, I'm on your side. Even when I think you're wrong. Okay?"

"Okay." Areeba smiled, genuine and warm. "Love you, sister."

"Love you too. Even though you're completely insane."

"We're," Areeba corrected with a small laugh. "We're completely insane."

Ayesha left, heading towards her room.

# CHAPTER 13: THE BETRAYAL

Ayesha left Areeba's room and walked down the hall to her own bedroomâ€”just three doors down in the house they'd shared their entire lives. Being sisters, not just cousins, meant there was no escaping each other. No going to separate homes to process the insanity. They were in this together, whether they liked it or not.

She closed her door and leaned against it, exhausted.

Her room was smaller than Areeba's, but tidierâ€”textbooks organized by subject on her shelf, her desk clear except for her laptop and a single potted succulent. Where Areeba's space was creative chaos, Ayesha's was controlled order.

Control. That's what this was all about, wasn't it? Ayesha was terrified because the situation was completely beyond anyone's control.

She changed into her pajamas and climbed into bed, but sleep didn't come easily. Her mind kept circling back to the same thoughts.

What did it feel like? To have someone else inside you, sharing your thoughts, your body, your existence? Areeba kept saying it was amazing, that Faisal made her feel complete. But how could sharing your consciousness with a dead person feel good?

Unless...

No. Ayesha pushed the thought away. She was being ridiculous.

But the question lingered.

---

The next few days passed with surprising normalcy. 

Areeba and Faisal seemed to have found their rhythm. At university, Areeba was more carefulâ€”still doing well in her classes, but not so brilliantly that it drew unwanted attention. She participated, but didn't dominate. She was helpful, but not suspiciously knowledgeable.

The jealousy incidents stopped. When Hamza said hello in the hallway, Areeba responded with friendly politeness and Faisal stayed quiet. When a guy from their Surveying lab asked to borrow her notes, she handed them over without Faisal's voice emerging to scare him off.

They were learning. Adapting. Making it work.

Ayesha watched it all with mixed feelings. Relief that they were being more careful. Worry that this meant the situation was becoming permanent. And underneath it all, a growing, nagging curiosity she couldn't quite suppress.

What did it feel like?

She saw the way Areeba would smile at nothing. The way her eyes would light up during those internal conversations. The confidence that seemed to radiate from her now, like she was never truly alone, never truly uncertain.

Part of Ayesha wanted to understand. 

Another part of her recognized that desire as dangerous.

By Friday, the curiosity had grown into something she couldn't ignore. Friday evening, Mama made haleem for dinnerâ€”rich and perfectly spiced, the kind of comfort food that made everything feel normal and safe. They ate as a family, Baba telling stories about his day at the office, Mama planning next week's meals, Areeba and Ayesha chiming in with commentary and jokes.

Normal. So completely normal.

Except Ayesha kept watching her sister. Watching the small smile that would cross her face. The way she'd pause mid-sentence sometimes, like she was listening to something no one else could hear. The subtle shifts in her expression that Ayesha had learned to recognize as internal dialogue.

After dinner, they migrated to their rooms. Ayesha tried to study, but the words in her textbook blurred together. She tried scrolling through social media, but nothing held her attention.

Finally, around eleven, she heard Areeba's light click off.

Ayesha waited. Fifteen minutes. Twenty. Long enough for Areeba to fall asleep.

Then she crept out of her room and padded down the hall in her bare feet.

Areeba's door was slightly ajar. Ayesha pushed it open slowly, wincing at the small creak of hinges. Inside, Areeba was curled on her side, breathing deeply and evenly. Asleep.

Ayesha stood in the doorway, her heart pounding. This was stupid. This was crazy. She should turn around and go back to her room and forget this wholeâ€”

But her feet carried her forward anyway.

She knelt beside Areeba's bed, close enough to see her sister's face in the dim light filtering through the curtains. Peaceful. Relaxed. Younger-looking in sleep.

"Faisal?" Ayesha whispered.

No response. Of course notâ€”he couldn't answer without using Areeba's voice, and Areeba was asleep.

But he could hear. Areeba had mentioned that Faisal didn't really sleep. That he was aware even when she wasn't, watching over her, keeping guard.

"Hey, Faisal," Ayesha whispered again, feeling ridiculous talking to her sleeping sister. "I know you can hear me. I know Areeba can't, but you can."

She paused, gathering courage for what she was about to ask.

"I've been thinking about... about what this is like for her. For both of you. And I realize I don't really understand. I can't understand unless..." She trailed off, then forced herself to continue. "By any chance, could you come to my body? Just for a little while. So I can feel what she feels. Understand what this is actually like."

Silence. Just Areeba's steady breathing.

"Please don't tell her," Ayesha added quickly. "This would be our secret. I just need to know. I need to understand what I'm actually dealing with here. What I'm asking her to risk."

More silence.

Ayesha waited, feeling foolish. This wasn't going to work. Spirits couldn't just jump from person to person likeâ€”

She stood up, ready to leave and forget this whole stupid idea.

And then she froze.

Literally frozeâ€”her body locking in place mid-step, one foot raised, arms still at her sides. She couldn't move. Couldn't speak. Could barely breathe.

*What's happening what's happening what'sâ€”*

*Easy.* 

The word formed in her mind, but it wasn't her thought. The voice was differentâ€”masculine, gentle, but definitely not hers.

*Don't fight it. I'm here. Just relax.*

And suddenly Ayesha understood what Areeba had been trying to explain. There was someone else in her head. Not controlling her thoughts, but... present. A consciousness that wasn't hers, existing alongside her own.

*Breathe,* Faisal's voice suggested. *You're holding your breath.*

Ayesha gasped, air flooding her lungs. Her body unlocked and she stumbled, catching herself on Areeba's desk chair.

*There you go. Better?*

"Oh my God," Ayesha whispered aloud. "Oh my God, this isâ€”"

*Overwhelming,* Faisal finished. *I know. It takes some getting used to. Areeba nearly fainted the first time.*

It was so strange, hearing his words in her mind while Areeba slept peacefully nearby. Like having a secret conversation in a language only she could understand.

*Can you hear me?* Ayesha thought, directing the question inward.

*Yes. You don't have to think so loud, though. I'm right here.*

*This is insane.*

*You're the one who asked for it.* There was amusement in his mental voice. *Did you want me to leave?*

*No!* The response came automatically, surprising her with its vehemence. Because now that he was here, now that she could feel this connectionâ€”she didn't want it to end.

It was like suddenly having company in a room she'd always thought was empty. Like discovering a whole new sense she hadn't known she was missing. Not invasive or uncomfortable, but... completing. Like finding the other half of a conversation she'd been having with herself her whole life.

"This is how she feels," Ayesha whispered. "All the time?"

*When I'm with her, yes.*

"No wonder she didn't want you to leave."

Ayesha moved to her own room in a daze, Faisal's presence a constant warmth in her mind. She climbed into bed and just lay there, marveling at the sensation of not being alone. Of having someone there, aware, present, real.

*Tell me about yourself,* Faisal said. *Areeba talks about you constantly, but I'd like to hear it from you.*

And so Ayesha did. Lying in the dark, she had a conversation with a spiritâ€”not out loud, but in the private space of her own mind. She told him about her fears, her dreams, her struggles in university. He listened, asked questions, offered insights that were thoughtful and kind.

Hours passed like minutes. At some point, Ayesha must have drifted off, because when she opened her eyes again, dawn light was creeping through her curtains.

And Faisal was still there.

*Good morning,* he said, and she could hear the smile in his mental voice.

*You stayed,* Ayesha thought groggily.

*I can't just go to Areeba at this distance... Go to her room.*

Ayesha sat up, running her hands through her tangled hair. The connection felt more natural now, less startling. Like it had always been there.

This was dangerous. She understood that intellectually. But emotionally? It felt amazing.

It felt right.

*I should go back to Areeba,* Faisal said reluctantly. *Before she wakes up and panics.*

*Right. Yes. Of course.* Ayesha felt an unexpected pang of loss. *Will you... tell her?*

*Do you want me to?*

*I don't know. I said it would be our secret, but...*

*Then it will be. For now, at least.*

*Thank you. For this. For letting me understand.*

*Thank you for caring about her enough to want to understand.*

The presence in her mind shifted, preparing to leave. Ayesha had a sudden, desperate urge to ask him to stayâ€”just a little longer, just a few more minutes.

But she didn't.

*Okay I will Go to her,* she thought. *She needs you more than I do.*

She walked towards her room, close enough so he could jump back to her. He was gone.

The absence was immediate and jarring. Ayesha's mind felt hollow, empty in a way it never had before. Like someone had taken away a limb she'd only just discovered she had.

She sat in her bed, hugging her knees, understanding for the first time why Areeba had been willing to risk everything to keep this.

Because having it and losing it would be unbearable.

Downstairs, Mama was making breakfastâ€”parathas and omelets, the Saturday morning routine. Ayesha headed down, her mind still reeling from the night's experience.

She'd almost reached the dining room when she heard itâ€”a door slamming upstairs. Hard.

Then footsteps, running.

Ayesha's stomach dropped. She knew that sound. Knew what it meant.

Areeba appeared at the top of the stairs, still in her pajamas, her hair wild from sleep. But it was her face that made Ayesha's breath catchâ€”pale, stricken, her eyes wide with something between panic and betrayal.

Their eyes met across the stairwell.

Areeba knew.

"Beta, breakfast is ready!" Mama called from the kitchen. "Come eat while it's hot!"

Areeba didn't move. Just stared at Ayesha with those wounded eyes.

*He didn't tell her,* Ayesha realized. *She woke up and he wasn't there and she knew.*

"Coming, Mama," Ayesha called back, her voice somehow steady despite the chaos in her chest. Then, quieter: "Areebaâ€”"

Areeba turned and went back to her room. The door closed with deliberate, controlled quietness that was somehow worse than another slam.

Breakfast was torture. Ayesha sat at the table, mechanically eating paratha she couldn't taste, while Mama chatted about weekend plans. Baba read the newspaper, occasionally commenting on headlines.

Normal family breakfast.

Except Areeba's chair was empty.

"Where's your sister?" Mama asked eventually.

"Not feeling well," Ayesha said. "She said she might sleep in."

"Hmm. I'll save her a plate."

As soon as breakfast was done, Ayesha headed upstairs. She stood outside Areeba's room, hand raised to knock, heart pounding.

Finally, she knocked.

"Go away."

"Areeba, please. Let me explainâ€”"

"There's nothing to explain. I know what you did."

"I just wanted to understandâ€”"

"By stealing him?" Areeba's voice was muffled through the door but thick with emotion. "By taking the one thing that was *mine?*"

"I didn't steal him! I just asked him toâ€”"

The door flew open. Areeba stood there, and Ayesha was shocked to see tears streaming down her face.

"You asked him to leave me," Areeba said, her voice breaking. "While I was sleeping. While I couldn't even know it was happening. Do you have any idea what that felt like? Waking up and feeling *empty?* Reaching for him and finding nothing?"

"Areeba, I'm sorryâ€”"

"Do you know what I thought?" Areeba continued, the words tumbling out in a rush. "I thought he'd left. I thought he'd decided I wasn't worth it and he'd just... gone. Back to the darkness. Alone. And I couldn't breathe, Ayesha. I literally couldn't breathe because the thought of losing himâ€”"

She broke off, wrapping her arms around herself.

Behind her, Ayesha could see her roomâ€”the bed rumpled from sleep, textbooks scattered on the floor like they'd been kicked in anger or despair.

"He came back," Ayesha said quietly. "He's here now, isn't he?"

"That's not the point!" Areeba's voice rose. "The point is you took him! Without asking me! Without even telling me! You just went behind my back andâ€”" She stopped, a new realization crossing her face. "Did he stay with you all night?"

Ayesha's silence was answer enough.

"Oh my God." Areeba's laugh was bitter. "Oh my God, he did. He spent the whole night with you."

Her expression flickeredâ€”that telltale sign of internal conversation. Faisal, trying to explain. Trying to defend himself.

"Just shut up," Areeba hissed, and Ayesha knew she wasn't talking to her. "I don't want to hear your excuses right now."

"Areeba, pleaseâ€”" Ayesha started.

"Get out."

"Let me explainâ€”"

Areeba's face shifted againâ€”Faisal, clearly trying to interject, trying to take control or at least speak. Areeba's jaw clenched, her whole body going rigid with the effort of keeping him silent.

"I said SHUT UP!" she snapped at the empty air beside her, tears streaming down her face. Then to Ayesha: "GET OUT!"

The shout brought footsteps from downstairsâ€”Mama, alarmed. "Girls? What's going on up there?"

"Nothing, Mama!" Areeba called, her voice suddenly controlled despite the tears on her face. "Just a disagreement. We're fine."

She looked at Ayesha, and the hurt in her eyes was devastating.

"Please leave," she said quietly. "I can't look at you right now."

"Butâ€”"

"And I can't talk to him either," Areeba added, her voice cracking. Her expression flickered again as Faisal clearly tried to speak. "No. I don't want to hear it. Not from either of you. So congratulations. You've managed to come between us. Happy now?"

She stepped back and closed the door. Not a slam this timeâ€”just a quiet, final click of the lock engaging.

Ayesha stood in the hallway, her own eyes burning with tears.

Inside the room, she could hear muffled sounds. Areeba, crying. And occasionally, her voice, sharp with anger: "Don't. I don't want to hear it. I don't care. No. Justâ€”just shut up, Faisal. Please. I can'tâ€”I just can't right now."

She was fighting with Faisal. Refusing to listen to him. Shutting him out even though he was right there, inside her, impossible to truly escape.

Ayesha had never felt worse in her life.

She'd wanted to understand. That's all. She'd wanted to know what her sister was experiencing, what was worth risking everything for.

And now she did know.

Now she understood exactly what Areeba stood to lose.

And she understood why the thought of losing itâ€”of being empty again after knowing that fullnessâ€”would be devastating.

Ayesha retreated to her own room and closed the door. She sat on her bed, hugging her pillow, feeling the hollow space in her mind where Faisal had been.

She'd only had him for a few hours. One night.

And the absence hurt.

Areeba had been living with this presence for over a week. Had grown accustomed to never being alone. Had built her entire sense of self around this partnership.

And Ayesha had ripped it away without warning, without permission, without even considering how it would feel.

*I'm such an idiot,* she thought.

Her phone buzzed. A text from Sana: *Study session tomorrow? I'm drowning in the hydraulics homework.*

Normal life, continuing around her.

While down the hall, her sister cried over a betrayal she couldn't explain to anyone. Fought with a spirit no one else could see. Dealt with emotions too complicated for the living to understand.

Ayesha typed back: *Can't tomorrow. Family stuff. Maybe next week?*

She set her phone aside and lay back on her bed, staring at the ceiling.

The worst part was that she understood now. She understood why Areeba had chosen this. Why she was willing to risk everything.

Because those few hours with Faisal had been the most not-alone Ayesha had ever felt in her life.

And if she'd had that for a week, had built her life around it, had fallen in love with itâ€”

She'd fight to keep it too.

Even if it meant not speaking to her sister.

Even if it meant shutting out the one person who actually knew her secret.

Even if it meant being completely, devastatingly alone in a crowded house.

Ayesha rolled over and pressed her face into her pillow, finally letting her own tears fall.

She'd wanted to understand.

Mission accomplished.

And it hurt more than she'd ever imagined.
