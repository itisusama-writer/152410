# CHAPTER 16: THE ARRANGEMENT

Three weeks passed.

Three weeks of Ayesha keeping her distance. Three weeks of polite nods in the hallway and careful silence at family meals. Three weeks of Ayesha forcing herself not to watch Areeba for signs of Faisal's presence, not to hover, not to ask.

The withdrawal was brutal.

Some mornings, Ayesha woke up feeling like she'd lost a limb. The emptiness in her mind was a constant ache, made worse by knowing exactly what was missing. She'd lie in bed, staring at the ceiling, fighting the urge to walk three doors down and beg for just a few minutes.

But she didn't.

Because she'd seen what her desperation had done to Areeba. Had seen the betrayal in her sister's eyes. And as much as Ayesha craved that connection, she craved her sister's forgiveness more.

So she stayed away. Focused on her classes. Threw herself into assignments and study groups with Sana. Tried to fill the hollow space with normal things—coffee with friends, late-night study sessions, mindless scrolling through social media.

It helped. A little.

Not enough, but a little.

The worst times were at home, when she could hear Areeba laughing at something in her room. Those moments when Ayesha knew Faisal had said something funny or sweet or interesting, and she wasn't part of it.

Those moments, the jealousy was still sharp enough to cut.

But she was learning to live with it.

Learning that wanting something didn't mean she had to have it.

Learning that some kinds of pain you just had to breathe through.

---

Midterm exams loomed at the end of October.

The engineering department scheduled them across different days—third-year courses on Monday and Tuesday, second-year courses on Wednesday and Thursday. Which meant Areeba and Ayesha would be taking their exams on different days.

Ayesha buried herself in preparation. Hydraulics, surveying, structural analysis—she made review sheets, worked through practice problems, formed study groups. The normal stress of exam week, amplified by her need for distraction.

Areeba seemed less stressed.

Actually, Areeba seemed completely calm.

Ayesha noticed it during dinner on the Sunday before exam week. While Ayesha was mentally reviewing formulas and worrying about time management, Areeba was relaxed, chatting with Mama about a recipe, laughing at Baba's jokes.

"You're not worried about exams?" Ayesha asked before she could stop herself.

It was the first direct question she'd asked Areeba in three weeks.

Areeba's smile faltered. "I've been studying."

"You seem really confident."

"I have a good understanding of the material."

There was something in her tone—not quite guilt, but close. Ayesha watched her sister's expression flicker in that telltale way.

Faisal, saying something.

And suddenly Ayesha understood.

Faisal had been a professor. He knew this material inside and out. And during exams, he could... what? Feed Areeba answers? Guide her through complex problems? Essentially take the test for her?

The unfair advantage was staggering.

Ayesha looked down at her plate, a complex mix of emotions churning in her stomach. Jealousy, yes—of course jealousy. But also something like concern.

Because if Areeba was cheating, even unintentionally, there would be consequences eventually.

---

Monday morning, Ayesha had her Hydraulics exam at 9 AM. She arrived early, found her assigned seat in the large examination hall, and laid out her calculator and pencils with shaking hands.

Around her, other students looked equally nervous. Some were doing last-minute cramming, flipping through notes. Others sat with their eyes closed, probably praying or trying to calm their nerves.

Normal exam anxiety.

The proctor distributed the papers face-down. "You have three hours. No talking, no phones, no collaboration. You may begin."

Ayesha flipped over her exam and started reading.

Question one: something about flow rates and pipe networks. She'd studied this. She knew this.

But as she started working through the problem, her mind kept drifting. Wondering if Areeba was taking her Urban Planning exam right now. Wondering if Faisal was whispering answers in her mind, making it easy.

*Focus,* Ayesha told herself. *This isn't about her.*

She forced her attention back to the problem, working through calculations methodically. It was hard—genuinely difficult material—but not impossible. She'd studied. She was prepared.

She just had to do it alone.

Three hours later, she emerged from the exam hall exhausted but satisfied. Not perfect, but decent. Honest.

She should have felt good about that.

Instead, she felt hollow.

---

That evening, Areeba knocked on her door.

Ayesha looked up from her Surveying notes, surprised. This was the first time Areeba had initiated contact since their fight.

"Can I come in?"

"Of course."

Areeba entered, closing the door behind her. She looked uncomfortable—arms crossed, not quite meeting Ayesha's eyes.

"How was your exam?" she asked.

"Okay, I think. Yours?"

"Easy." Areeba's voice was quiet. "Too easy."

She sat down on the edge of Ayesha's bed, finally looking at her directly.

"Faisal helped me. During the exam. I didn't even have to ask—he just started explaining answers, showing me how to solve problems I was stuck on. And I..." She swallowed. "I let him."

Ayesha waited, not sure where this was going.

"I got a perfect score," Areeba continued. "Or near-perfect. I could feel it while I was taking it. Every answer right, every calculation flawless. And it felt wrong, Ayesha. It felt like cheating."

"Because it was cheating."

"I know." Areeba's voice was miserable. "But what was I supposed to do? Tell him to stop? Have a mental argument with a spirit during an exam? Make myself look crazy and still fail the test?"

"You could have studied without his help. Been prepared on your own."

"I did study! But when you have someone in your head who knows all the answers, it's impossible not to hear them. It's not like I can turn him off."

Ayesha felt a flicker of sympathy despite herself. Because Areeba was right—how do you ignore someone who shares your consciousness?

"So what are you going to do?" Ayesha asked.

Areeba took a shaky breath. "That's why I'm here. I have three more exams this week. And I can't—I can't keep doing this. It's not right. I'm not earning these grades, and eventually someone's going to notice that I went from average student to genius overnight."

"Okay..."

"So I need to not have him during my exams." Areeba's hands twisted together in her lap. "Which means he needs to be somewhere else."

Understanding dawned slowly.

"You want to send him to me," Ayesha said.

"I know. I know how that sounds after everything I said. After I told you to stay away and never ask again." Areeba's voice was strained. "But I don't know what else to do. You have exams on different days than me. So when I'm taking a test, he could be with you, and when you're testing, he could be with me."

"You want to share him."

"I want to not cheat!" Areeba's voice rose slightly, then dropped again. "I want to earn my degree honestly. And the only way I can do that is if he's not in my head whispering answers."

Ayesha's heart was racing. This was what she'd wanted—access to Faisal, that beautiful connection. But not like this. Not as a favor. Not with Areeba looking so miserable about offering it.

"What does Faisal think?" she asked.

Areeba's expression flickered. "He thinks it's my decision. He'll do whatever I ask. But he's worried about you."

"About me?"

"About you getting too attached. About this making your... withdrawal... worse instead of better." Areeba met her eyes. "And I'm worried about that too. But I'm more worried about becoming someone who cheats their way through university."

The room fell silent except for the distant sound of Mama washing dishes downstairs.

"If we do this," Ayesha said slowly, "we need rules."

"Agreed."

"When you're in exams, he comes to me. When I'm in exams, he goes to you. Otherwise, he stays with you. No exceptions."

"Okay."

"And I don't ask for more. I don't beg or manipulate or blackmail." Shame heated Ayesha's face. "I'm sorry about that, by the way. Really sorry. I was desperate and I—"

"I know." Areeba's voice was quiet. "I forgive you. I don't like what you did, but I understand why. And I'm sorry too. For rubbing it in your face. For not being more careful about showing how happy I was."

"You have nothing to apologize for. He's yours. You should be happy."

"Still." Areeba took a breath. "So we're agreed? This is just for exams. Just so I can avoid cheating. Nothing more."

"Nothing more," Ayesha agreed, trying to ignore the way her heart leapt at the prospect.

"And Ayesha?" Areeba's voice turned serious. "You have to promise not to get too close to him. Not to... I don't know, try to make him like you better or convince him to stay with you longer or anything like that."

The words stung, but they were fair.

"I promise. This is temporary and practical. I won't try to steal him from you."

"Okay." Areeba stood up, looking relieved but still worried. "I have Building Technology tomorrow at 2 PM. Your Surveying exam is at 9, right?"

"Right."

"So he'll come to you tomorrow at 2. And then back to me when your exam starts on Wednesday."

"Okay."

Areeba moved toward the door, then paused. "Thank you. For agreeing to help. I know this is weird for both of us."

"It is," Ayesha admitted. "But it's the right thing to do. You shouldn't have to cheat."

After Areeba left, Ayesha sat at her desk, staring at her Surveying notes without seeing them.

Tomorrow at 2 PM, Faisal would be in her mind again.

Not because she'd begged or threatened or manipulated.

Because Areeba had asked. Because it was the ethical choice. Because they were helping each other.

It should have felt better than it did.

But all Ayesha could think about was the timer Areeba would inevitably set. The moment when he'd have to leave again. The emptiness that would follow.

*Don't get too close,* she reminded herself. *This is temporary. Practical. Nothing more.*

But already, her heart was racing with anticipation.

Already, she was counting down the hours.

Already, she knew keeping her promise would be harder than making it.

---

Tuesday at 1:55 PM, Ayesha was sitting on her bed, trying to look calm.

She'd finished her morning classes and come straight home. Mama was out shopping with a friend. Baba was at work. The house was quiet.

Areeba appeared in her doorway at 1:58, looking pale.

"Ready?" she asked.

"Ready."

Areeba came in and sat in the desk chair—the same position as last time. Her hands gripped the armrests, and Ayesha could see she was already steeling herself for the emptiness.

"Two hours," Areeba said. "That's how long my exam is. Plus maybe twenty minutes for me to get there and back. So let's say two and a half hours maximum."

"Okay."

"And remember—"

"I know. Don't get too close. I remember."

Areeba nodded, taking a shaky breath. Her expression went distant as she talked to Faisal—saying goodbye, probably. Preparing herself.

Then her face went slack, and Ayesha gasped as the presence flooded her mind.

*Hello, Ayesha.*

It was just as overwhelming as before. Just as complete. The hollow space filling with warmth and awareness and connection.

*Hi,* she thought back, trying to sound casual and not desperately grateful.

*How are you doing? Really?*

*Better. I've been trying to... to handle it better.*

*I'm proud of you. I know that's been hard.*

The kindness in his mental voice made her want to cry.

Across the room, Areeba stood up shakily. Her face was carefully blank, but Ayesha could see the tension in her shoulders, the way she was breathing too carefully.

"I'm going now," Areeba said, her voice hollow. "Two and a half hours. Not a minute more."

"Good luck on your exam."

"Thanks."

Areeba left, and Ayesha heard the front door close a few minutes later. Then the house was silent except for her own breathing and the strange doubled awareness of her thoughts.

*She's struggling,* Faisal observed.

*I know. This is hard for her.*

*For both of you.*

*Yeah.*

Ayesha lay back on her bed, letting herself simply experience the connection. She'd promised not to get too close, but surely she could enjoy this while it lasted?

*Tell me about your exam yesterday,* Faisal said. *How did it go?*

And they talked—about hydraulics and engineering and university stress. Comfortable conversation, like talking to a friend. Except more intimate because he was in her mind, sharing her thoughts, understanding her in a way no one else could.

Time slipped by too quickly.

After what felt like thirty minutes but was probably closer to an hour, Faisal went quiet for a moment, then said: *We should talk about boundaries.*

*What do you mean?*

*I mean this situation is complicated. And I don't want you to get hurt.*

*I'll be fine.*

*Will you?* His mental voice was gentle but skeptical. *Because you're already feeling that pull, aren't you? Already wanting more than these few hours?*

Ayesha didn't answer, which was answer enough.

*I care about you,* Faisal said. *As Areeba's sister, as someone I'm getting to know. But I can't be what you need. I belong with Areeba. My connection is to her.*

*I know that.*

*Do you? Because I can feel your emotions, Ayesha. The longing. The attachment forming. And I'm worried about what happens when this ends.*

*It's not going to end. We have all week. Multiple exams.*

*I mean long-term. After exam week is over. When you go back to not having this.*

The thought made her chest ache.

*I'll handle it,* she thought firmly. *I handled these last three weeks, didn't I?*

*Barely.*

*But I did. And I will again. I'm not going to make this harder for Areeba. I promised.*

*Okay.* He sounded unconvinced. *But if it gets too difficult, you need to tell her. You need to stop this before it hurts you worse.*

*I will.*

But they both knew she was lying.

Two hours and twenty-three minutes after Areeba left, Ayesha heard the front door open.

Her sister's footsteps on the stairs were slower than usual. Deliberate. Like she was dreading what came next.

Areeba appeared in the doorway, her face carefully composed but her eyes rimmed with red. She'd been crying. During her exam or after, Ayesha couldn't tell.

"How did it go?" Ayesha asked.

"Hard. Really hard." Areeba's voice was strained. "I second-guessed every answer. Couldn't remember half the material. I probably failed."

"I'm sorry."

"It's fine. It's honest." Areeba's hands clenched at her sides. "Can I have him back now?"

The desperation in her voice was like a mirror of Ayesha's own feelings.

"Of course."

*Thank you for this,* Ayesha thought to Faisal. *I know it's complicated.*

*Take care of yourself,* he replied. *Please.*

Then he was gone, and the emptiness crashed back in.

Areeba's whole body sagged with relief as Faisal returned to her. Color flooded her face. Her breathing steadied. She pressed a hand to her chest like she was making sure he was really there.

"Thank you," she whispered. "For... for doing this."

"Of course."

They looked at each other across the room—two sisters, both addicted to the same presence, trying to share something that couldn't really be shared.

"Same time Thursday?" Areeba asked.

"I have my Structural Analysis exam at 10. So maybe 10:30?"

"Okay." Areeba turned to leave, then paused. "Are you okay? With all this?"

Ayesha wanted to say yes. Wanted to be strong and selfless and fine with these scraps of connection.

But Areeba deserved honesty.

"No," she said quietly. "But I will be. And this is the right thing to do. So we'll make it work."

Areeba nodded, understanding and guilt warring on her face.

"I'm sorry," she said. "For having what you want. For not being able to share it properly. For all of this."

"Don't be sorry for being loved," Ayesha said, and meant it.

After Areeba left, Ayesha sat in the hollow silence of her room, already counting the hours until Thursday.

Already breaking her promise not to get too close.

Already knowing this arrangement would help Areeba stay honest but might destroy Ayesha in the process.

But what choice did she have?

She'd tasted connection. Known completion. Felt what it was like to not be alone.

And now she'd take whatever scraps she could get.

Even if it meant falling apart a little more each time he left.

Even if it meant watching her sister have everything she wanted while Ayesha survived on borrowed hours and temporary presence.

It wasn't healthy.

It wasn't fair.

But it was all she had.

And she'd take it.

God help her, she'd take it.
