# CHAPTER 13: THE BETRAYAL

Ayesha left Areeba's room and walked down the hall to her own bedroom—just three doors down in the house they'd shared their entire lives. Being sisters, not just cousins, meant there was no escaping each other. No going to separate homes to process the insanity. They were in this together, whether they liked it or not.

She closed her door and leaned against it, exhausted.

Her room was smaller than Areeba's, but tidier—textbooks organized by subject on her shelf, her desk clear except for her laptop and a single potted succulent. Where Areeba's space was creative chaos, Ayesha's was controlled order.

Control. That's what this was all about, wasn't it? Ayesha was terrified because the situation was completely beyond anyone's control.

She changed into her pajamas and climbed into bed, but sleep didn't come easily. Her mind kept circling back to the same thoughts.

What did it feel like? To have someone else inside you, sharing your thoughts, your body, your existence? Areeba kept saying it was amazing, that Faisal made her feel complete. But how could sharing your consciousness with a dead person feel good?

Unless...

No. Ayesha pushed the thought away. She was being ridiculous.

But the question lingered.

---

The next few days passed with surprising normalcy. 

Areeba and Faisal seemed to have found their rhythm. At university, Areeba was more careful—still doing well in her classes, but not so brilliantly that it drew unwanted attention. She participated, but didn't dominate. She was helpful, but not suspiciously knowledgeable.

The jealousy incidents stopped. When Hamza said hello in the hallway, Areeba responded with friendly politeness and Faisal stayed quiet. When a guy from their Surveying lab asked to borrow her notes, she handed them over without Faisal's voice emerging to scare him off.

They were learning. Adapting. Making it work.

Ayesha watched it all with mixed feelings. Relief that they were being more careful. Worry that this meant the situation was becoming permanent. And underneath it all, a growing, nagging curiosity she couldn't quite suppress.

What did it feel like?

She saw the way Areeba would smile at nothing. The way her eyes would light up during those internal conversations. The confidence that seemed to radiate from her now, like she was never truly alone, never truly uncertain.

Part of Ayesha wanted to understand. 

Another part of her recognized that desire as dangerous.

By Friday, the curiosity had grown into something she couldn't ignore. Friday evening, Mama made haleem for dinner—rich and perfectly spiced, the kind of comfort food that made everything feel normal and safe. They ate as a family, Baba telling stories about his day at the office, Mama planning next week's meals, Areeba and Ayesha chiming in with commentary and jokes.

Normal. So completely normal.

Except Ayesha kept watching her sister. Watching the small smile that would cross her face. The way she'd pause mid-sentence sometimes, like she was listening to something no one else could hear. The subtle shifts in her expression that Ayesha had learned to recognize as internal dialogue.

After dinner, they migrated to their rooms. Ayesha tried to study, but the words in her textbook blurred together. She tried scrolling through social media, but nothing held her attention.

Finally, around eleven, she heard Areeba's light click off.

Ayesha waited. Fifteen minutes. Twenty. Long enough for Areeba to fall asleep.

Then she crept out of her room and padded down the hall in her bare feet.

Areeba's door was slightly ajar. Ayesha pushed it open slowly, wincing at the small creak of hinges. Inside, Areeba was curled on her side, breathing deeply and evenly. Asleep.

Ayesha stood in the doorway, her heart pounding. This was stupid. This was crazy. She should turn around and go back to her room and forget this whole—

But her feet carried her forward anyway.

She knelt beside Areeba's bed, close enough to see her sister's face in the dim light filtering through the curtains. Peaceful. Relaxed. Younger-looking in sleep.

"Faisal?" Ayesha whispered.

No response. Of course not—he couldn't answer without using Areeba's voice, and Areeba was asleep.

But he could hear. Areeba had mentioned that Faisal didn't really sleep. That he was aware even when she wasn't, watching over her, keeping guard.

"Hey, Faisal," Ayesha whispered again, feeling ridiculous talking to her sleeping sister. "I know you can hear me. I know Areeba can't, but you can."

She paused, gathering courage for what she was about to ask.

"I've been thinking about... about what this is like for her. For both of you. And I realize I don't really understand. I can't understand unless..." She trailed off, then forced herself to continue. "By any chance, could you come to my body? Just for a little while. So I can feel what she feels. Understand what this is actually like."

Silence. Just Areeba's steady breathing.

"Please don't tell her," Ayesha added quickly. "This would be our secret. I just need to know. I need to understand what I'm actually dealing with here. What I'm asking her to risk."

More silence.

Ayesha waited, feeling foolish. This wasn't going to work. Spirits couldn't just jump from person to person like—

She stood up, ready to leave and forget this whole stupid idea.

And then she froze.

Literally froze—her body locking in place mid-step, one foot raised, arms still at her sides. She couldn't move. Couldn't speak. Could barely breathe.

*What's happening what's happening what's—*

*Easy.* 

The word formed in her mind, but it wasn't her thought. The voice was different—masculine, gentle, but definitely not hers.

*Don't fight it. I'm here. Just relax.*

And suddenly Ayesha understood what Areeba had been trying to explain. There was someone else in her head. Not controlling her thoughts, but... present. A consciousness that wasn't hers, existing alongside her own.

*Breathe,* Faisal's voice suggested. *You're holding your breath.*

Ayesha gasped, air flooding her lungs. Her body unlocked and she stumbled, catching herself on Areeba's desk chair.

*There you go. Better?*

"Oh my God," Ayesha whispered aloud. "Oh my God, this is—"

*Overwhelming,* Faisal finished. *I know. It takes some getting used to. Areeba nearly fainted the first time.*

It was so strange, hearing his words in her mind while Areeba slept peacefully nearby. Like having a secret conversation in a language only she could understand.

*Can you hear me?* Ayesha thought, directing the question inward.

*Yes. You don't have to think so loud, though. I'm right here.*

*This is insane.*

*You're the one who asked for it.* There was amusement in his mental voice. *Did you want me to leave?*

*No!* The response came automatically, surprising her with its vehemence. Because now that he was here, now that she could feel this connection—she didn't want it to end.

It was like suddenly having company in a room she'd always thought was empty. Like discovering a whole new sense she hadn't known she was missing. Not invasive or uncomfortable, but... completing. Like finding the other half of a conversation she'd been having with herself her whole life.

"This is how she feels," Ayesha whispered. "All the time?"

*When I'm with her, yes.*

"No wonder she didn't want you to leave."

Ayesha moved to her own room in a daze, Faisal's presence a constant warmth in her mind. She climbed into bed and just lay there, marveling at the sensation of not being alone. Of having someone there, aware, present, real.

*Tell me about yourself,* Faisal said. *Areeba talks about you constantly, but I'd like to hear it from you.*

And so Ayesha did. Lying in the dark, she had a conversation with a spirit—not out loud, but in the private space of her own mind. She told him about her fears, her dreams, her struggles in university. He listened, asked questions, offered insights that were thoughtful and kind.

Hours passed like minutes. At some point, Ayesha must have drifted off, because when she opened her eyes again, dawn light was creeping through her curtains.

And Faisal was still there.

*Good morning,* he said, and she could hear the smile in his mental voice.

*You stayed,* Ayesha thought groggily.

*I can't just go to Areeba at this distance... Go to her room.*

Ayesha sat up, running her hands through her tangled hair. The connection felt more natural now, less startling. Like it had always been there.

This was dangerous. She understood that intellectually. But emotionally? It felt amazing.

It felt right.

*I should go back to Areeba,* Faisal said reluctantly. *Before she wakes up and panics.*

*Right. Yes. Of course.* Ayesha felt an unexpected pang of loss. *Will you... tell her?*

*Do you want me to?*

*I don't know. I said it would be our secret, but...*

*Then it will be. For now, at least.*

*Thank you. For this. For letting me understand.*

*Thank you for caring about her enough to want to understand.*

The presence in her mind shifted, preparing to leave. Ayesha had a sudden, desperate urge to ask him to stay—just a little longer, just a few more minutes.

But she didn't.

*Okay I will Go to her,* she thought. *She needs you more than I do.*

She walked towards her room, close enough so he could jump back to her. He was gone.

The absence was immediate and jarring. Ayesha's mind felt hollow, empty in a way it never had before. Like someone had taken away a limb she'd only just discovered she had.

She sat in her bed, hugging her knees, understanding for the first time why Areeba had been willing to risk everything to keep this.

Because having it and losing it would be unbearable.

---

Downstairs, Mama was making breakfast—parathas and omelets, the Saturday morning routine. Ayesha headed down, her mind still reeling from the night's experience.

She'd almost reached the dining room when she heard it—a door slamming upstairs. Hard.

Then footsteps, running.

Ayesha's stomach dropped. She knew that sound. Knew what it meant.

Areeba appeared at the top of the stairs, still in her pajamas, her hair wild from sleep. But it was her face that made Ayesha's breath catch—pale, stricken, her eyes wide with something between panic and betrayal.

Their eyes met across the stairwell.

Areeba knew.

"Beta, breakfast is ready!" Mama called from the kitchen. "Come eat while it's hot!"

Areeba didn't move. Just stared at Ayesha with those wounded eyes.

*He didn't tell her,* Ayesha realized. *She woke up and he wasn't there and she knew.*

"Coming, Mama," Ayesha called back, her voice somehow steady despite the chaos in her chest. Then, quieter: "Areeba—"

Areeba turned and went back to her room. The door closed with deliberate, controlled quietness that was somehow worse than another slam.

Breakfast was torture. Ayesha sat at the table, mechanically eating paratha she couldn't taste, while Mama chatted about weekend plans. Baba read the newspaper, occasionally commenting on headlines.

Normal family breakfast.

Except Areeba's chair was empty.

"Where's your sister?" Mama asked eventually.

"Not feeling well," Ayesha said. "She said she might sleep in."

"Hmm. I'll save her a plate."

As soon as breakfast was done, Ayesha headed upstairs. She stood outside Areeba's room, hand raised to knock, heart pounding.

Finally, she knocked.

"Go away."

"Areeba, please. Let me explain—"

"There's nothing to explain. I know what you did."

"I just wanted to understand—"

"By stealing him?" Areeba's voice was muffled through the door but thick with emotion. "By taking the one thing that was *mine?*"

"I didn't steal him! I just asked him to—"

The door flew open. Areeba stood there, and Ayesha was shocked to see tears streaming down her face.

"You asked him to leave me," Areeba said, her voice breaking. "While I was sleeping. While I couldn't even know it was happening. Do you have any idea what that felt like? Waking up and feeling *empty?* Reaching for him and finding nothing?"

"Areeba, I'm sorry—"

"Do you know what I thought?" Areeba continued, the words tumbling out in a rush. "I thought he'd left. I thought he'd decided I wasn't worth it and he'd just... gone. Back to the darkness. Alone. And I couldn't breathe, Ayesha. I literally couldn't breathe because the thought of losing him—"

She broke off, wrapping her arms around herself.

Behind her, Ayesha could see her room—the bed rumpled from sleep, textbooks scattered on the floor like they'd been kicked in anger or despair.

"He came back," Ayesha said quietly. "He's here now, isn't he?"

"That's not the point!" Areeba's voice rose. "The point is you took him! Without asking me! Without even telling me! You just went behind my back and—" She stopped, a new realization crossing her face. "Did he stay with you all night?"

Ayesha's silence was answer enough.

"Oh my God." Areeba's laugh was bitter. "Oh my God, he did. He spent the whole night with you."

Her expression flickered—that telltale sign of internal conversation. Faisal, trying to explain. Trying to defend himself.

"Just shut up," Areeba hissed, and Ayesha knew she wasn't talking to her. "I don't want to hear your excuses right now."

"Areeba, please—" Ayesha started.

"Get out."

"Let me explain—"

Areeba's face shifted again—Faisal, clearly trying to interject, trying to take control or at least speak. Areeba's jaw clenched, her whole body going rigid with the effort of keeping him silent.

"I said SHUT UP!" she snapped at the empty air beside her, tears streaming down her face. Then to Ayesha: "GET OUT!"

The shout brought footsteps from downstairs—Mama, alarmed. "Girls? What's going on up there?"

"Nothing, Mama!" Areeba called, her voice suddenly controlled despite the tears on her face. "Just a disagreement. We're fine."

She looked at Ayesha, and the hurt in her eyes was devastating.

"Please leave," she said quietly. "I can't look at you right now."

"But—"

"And I can't talk to him either," Areeba added, her voice cracking. Her expression flickered again as Faisal clearly tried to speak. "No. I don't want to hear it. Not from either of you. So congratulations. You've managed to come between us. Happy now?"

She stepped back and closed the door. Not a slam this time—just a quiet, final click of the lock engaging.

Ayesha stood in the hallway, her own eyes burning with tears.

Inside the room, she could hear muffled sounds. Areeba, crying. And occasionally, her voice, sharp with anger: "Don't. I don't want to hear it. I don't care. No. Just—just shut up, Faisal. Please. I can't—I just can't right now."

She was fighting with Faisal. Refusing to listen to him. Shutting him out even though he was right there, inside her, impossible to truly escape.

Ayesha had never felt worse in her life.

She'd wanted to understand. That's all. She'd wanted to know what her sister was experiencing, what was worth risking everything for.

And now she did know.

Now she understood exactly what Areeba stood to lose.

And she understood why the thought of losing it—of being empty again after knowing that fullness—would be devastating.

Ayesha retreated to her own room and closed the door. She sat on her bed, hugging her pillow, feeling the hollow space in her mind where Faisal had been.

She'd only had him for a few hours. One night.

And the absence hurt.

Areeba had been living with this presence for over a week. Had grown accustomed to never being alone. Had built her entire sense of self around this partnership.

And Ayesha had ripped it away without warning, without permission, without even considering how it would feel.

*I'm such an idiot,* she thought.

Her phone buzzed. A text from Sana: *Study session tomorrow? I'm drowning in the hydraulics homework.*

Normal life, continuing around her.

While down the hall, her sister cried over a betrayal she couldn't explain to anyone. Fought with a spirit no one else could see. Dealt with emotions too complicated for the living to understand.

Ayesha typed back: *Can't tomorrow. Family stuff. Maybe next week?*

She set her phone aside and lay back on her bed, staring at the ceiling.

The worst part was that she understood now. She understood why Areeba had chosen this. Why she was willing to risk everything.

Because those few hours with Faisal had been the most not-alone Ayesha had ever felt in her life.

And if she'd had that for a week, had built her life around it, had fallen in love with it—

She'd fight to keep it too.

Even if it meant not speaking to her sister.

Even if it meant shutting out the one person who actually knew her secret.

Even if it meant being completely, devastatingly alone in a crowded house.

Ayesha rolled over and pressed her face into her pillow, finally letting her own tears fall.

She'd wanted to understand.

Mission accomplished.

And it hurt more than she'd ever imagined.
