# CHAPTER 10: THE CHOICE

The next morning dawned gray and drizzly, as if the mountains themselves were mourning the family's departure. Ayesha woke to the sound of suitcases being zipped and bags being shuffled around Room 9.

"Can't believe the trip is already over," Aunt Sadia said, folding clothes with practiced efficiency. "Feels like we just got here."

"My back disagrees," Aunt Fareeda replied, stretching with a wince. "My back says we've been climbing mountains for a year."

Areeba sat on her bed, packing her things with unusual slowness. Her movements were careful, deliberate, like she was trying to memorize the act of folding each piece of clothing. Her expression was distant, melancholy.

Ayesha recognized the look. Areeba was talking to Faisal. And from the sadness in her eyes, it wasn't a happy conversation.

"You okay, beta?" Aunt Fareeda asked, noticing Areeba's mood. "You've been so quiet this morning."

"Just sad to leave," Areeba said, and her voice carried genuine emotion. "It's been... special here."

"We'll come back," Aunt Sadia assured her. "Maybe next summer. Make it a tradition."

Areeba's smile was bittersweet. "Maybe."

They finished packing and hauled their luggage downstairs. The lobby was chaotic with families checking out, bags piled everywhere, children running around burning off last-minute energy before the long bus ride back to Lahore.

Uncle Jamil was settling the bill at the front desk. Uncle Tariq was doing a headcount to make sure they hadn't lost any children. The male cousins were loading bags onto the same coaster bus that had brought them here—was it really only four days ago? It felt like a lifetime.

Ayesha watched Areeba standing slightly apart from the group, staring out at the mountains visible through the lobby windows. Her lips were moving in that now-familiar pattern of silent conversation.

"I don't want to leave either," Areeba whispered to the air. "I know. I know. We'll figure it out. I promise."

She reached out her hand, and for just a moment—barely a flicker—Faisal's translucent form appeared beside her, his ghostly hand touching hers. The image was there and gone so quickly Ayesha might have imagined it.

"Areeba!" Aunt Fareeda called. "Come help with these bags!"

Areeba turned away from the window, her expression smoothing into normalcy. She grabbed a bag and headed outside where the bus waited, its engine already rumbling.

The family loaded up in a controlled chaos of bags and bodies and last-minute bathroom runs. The hotel staff waved goodbye. The street vendors they'd gotten to know over the past few days called out safe journey wishes.

Finally, everyone was aboard. The driver closed the door with a hydraulic hiss, and the bus lurched into motion, leaving Lalazar Hotel behind.

Ayesha had ended up in a seat near the back, with Areeba beside her. The aunts were a few rows ahead. The male cousins were scattered throughout. Uncle Jamil sat up front, already dozing.

As the bus navigated through Naran Bazaar one last time, Areeba pressed her face to the window, watching the mountains disappear behind them with each turn of the road.

"You're really going to miss it," Ayesha observed quietly.

"It's where we—" Areeba caught herself. "Where I figured things out. Where everything changed."

Where you fell in love with your possessor, Ayesha thought but didn't say.

The bus climbed out of the valley, retracing the route they'd taken days ago. Past Saif-ul-Malook's turnoff. Past the checkpoint. Down through the switchbacks that had terrified them on the way up but seemed almost tame now.

Areeba kept up a constant quiet murmur—talking to Faisal, Ayesha knew. Making plans. Saying things she didn't want anyone else to hear.

They'd been traveling for about an hour when Aunt Fareeda turned around in her seat, looking back at Areeba.

"Beta, who is this Faisal you keep talking about?"

The question dropped into the bus like a stone into still water.

Areeba went white. Her mouth opened but no sound came out. Around them, other family members were turning, curious about the question.

"What?" Areeba finally managed, her voice strangled.

"Faisal," Aunt Fareeda repeated. "You keep saying that name. I've heard you several times over the past couple days. 'Faisal this' and 'Faisal that.' Who is he? A friend from university?"

Ayesha's heart hammered. This was it. The moment of exposure. There was no good answer to this question. No way to explain—

"I am Faisal."

The words came from Areeba's mouth, but the voice was slightly different. Deeper. Masculine. Faisal had taken control.

Every head in the nearby seats turned. Aunt Fareeda's eyebrows shot up. "You are?"

Faisal opened his mouth—Areeba's mouth—and Ayesha could see the panic in her eyes even as he controlled the body. He had no idea what to say. He'd just bought them seconds, not a solution.

Then Areeba pushed forward, taking control back mid-sentence.

"—means I am writing a story!" The words tumbled out in a rush. "About myself. A fictionalized version. And in that story, I... I made myself a male character. Named Faisal. For fun. To see the world from a different perspective."

She was breathing hard from the effort of the lie and the rapid switch of control. In Ayesha's mind, she could almost hear the conversation happening at lightning speed inside Areeba's head.

*That was close.*

*I panicked. Sorry.*

*It's okay. Was that believable?*

*I don't know. Keep going.*

"A story?" Aunt Sadia had turned around now too, intrigued. "Like a novel?"

"More like... creative writing. An exercise." Areeba's hands twisted in her lap. "My professor assigned it. Write about yourself but change your gender and see how it affects your perspective on events. So I've been... narrating the trip. In my head. As Faisal. That's why you heard me saying the name."

The lie was elaborate enough to be believable. Specific enough to sound real. And exactly the kind of artsy thing a university student might be assigned.

Ayesha held her breath.

Aunt Fareeda considered this. "That's... actually quite interesting. What's it like? Being a boy in your story?"

"Different," Areeba said, which was probably the truest thing she'd said all morning. "Very different. Liberating in some ways. Confusing in others. It's made me think about things I wouldn't normally think about."

"Like what?" Aunt Sadia asked, genuinely curious now.

Areeba glanced at Ayesha—a quick, panicked look—before answering. "Like how differently people treat you based on gender. How much more physical freedom men have. How different the internal dialogue is when you're not constantly worried about safety and propriety and what people think."

"Hmm." Aunt Fareeda nodded thoughtfully. "You'll have to let us read it when you're done."

"It's not very good," Areeba said quickly. "Just an exercise. Very rough."

"Still. I'd be interested." Aunt Fareeda smiled and turned back around in her seat.

The moment passed. The crisis averted. Around them, the bus rumbled on, other passengers returning to their own conversations and activities.

Ayesha leaned close to Areeba and whispered, "Nice cover."

"Faisal said that too," Areeba whispered back, then caught herself. "Sorry. Habit."

"You're going to slip up eventually. You know that, right?"

"I know." Areeba's voice was barely audible. "We're working on it."

They rode in silence for a while, watching the landscape change as they descended—the barren peaks giving way to pine forests, the pine forests to rocky hills, the hills to the beginnings of the plains.

"Areeba," Ayesha said quietly, "can we talk? Really talk?"

"Okay."

"In the bathroom. More private."

They waited until the bus made its first rest stop—the same gas station where Areeba had fainted days ago. Ayesha's stomach twisted at the memory. This was where it had all started. Where Faisal had taken control for the second time.

While the family scattered to use facilities and stretch their legs, Ayesha grabbed Areeba's arm and pulled her toward the women's restroom. It was as grimy and unpleasant as before, but it was private.

"We need to talk about what happens when we get back to Lahore," Ayesha said without preamble.

Areeba leaned against the sink, her expression guarded. "I know."

"You can't keep this up. Not at home. Not around more people, not with our parents, not at university—"

"I know," Areeba repeated.

"So you have to leave him." The words came out harder than Ayesha intended. "Faisal. You have to make him go. Before we get back. While you're still strong enough to push him out."

Areeba's expression didn't change. She just stared at Ayesha with eyes that held both her sister and someone else.

"You have to separate," Ayesha pressed. "Find a way. Ask him to leave. Force him if you have to. But this can't continue—"

"No."

The word was quiet but absolute.

"Areeba—"

"No," Areeba repeated, louder now. "I'm not leaving him. He's coming with me. Back to Lahore. Back to my life. All of it."

"You can't be serious—"

"I'm completely serious." Areeba straightened, and for the first time since this conversation started, she looked Ayesha directly in the eyes. "He's part of me now. I'm not giving that up."

"He's possessing you!"

"He's partnering with me," Areeba corrected. "There's a difference. And I choose this. I choose him."

Ayesha felt desperation rising in her chest. "Think about what you're saying! You're choosing to share your body, your life, your entire existence with a spirit we know nothing about! We don't know what he is, where he came from, what he wants—"

"I know what he wants," Areeba said softly. "He wants to live. To experience the world. To not be alone in the darkness anymore. And I want to help him. I want him with me."

"Why?" The question came out almost as a plea. "Why would you want this?"

Areeba was quiet for a long moment. When she spoke, her voice was gentle, patient, like she was explaining something to a child.

"Because he understands me. Because he makes me brave. Because when I'm scared, he's strong. When he's lonely, I'm there. We complete each other in a way I can't explain. And yes, I know how that sounds. I know it's not normal. But it's real. It's mine. And I'm not giving it up."

"Our parents—"

"Won't know. We'll be careful. More careful than we've been here."

"Your friends—"

"Don't know me like he does anyway."

"Your future—"

"Is mine to decide!" Areeba's voice rose, echoing off the bathroom tiles. She took a breath, calming herself. "Ayesha. I love you. You're my sister in every way that matters. But this is my choice. My life. My body. And I'm choosing to share it with Faisal. Permanently."

The finality in her voice was unmistakable. This wasn't a decision she was still wrestling with. This was done. Decided. Final.

Ayesha felt tears prick her eyes. "I'm losing you."

"No." Areeba stepped forward and took Ayesha's hands. Her grip was warm, solid, real. "You're not losing me. I'm still here. I'm still your favorite, your sister, your friend. I'm just... more now. We're more. And I need you to accept that. To accept us."

"And if I can't?" Ayesha's voice broke. "If I think this is wrong and dangerous and I need to tell someone?"

Areeba's expression hardened slightly. "Then I'll deny it. I'll say I'm fine. That you're imagining things. That the altitude sickness affected you more than it affected me. And they'll believe me because I'll seem normal and you'll seem paranoid." She squeezed Ayesha's hands. "Please don't make me do that. Please don't make me choose between you and him."

"You already have chosen," Ayesha whispered. "You chose him."

"I'm choosing both of you," Areeba corrected. "If you'll let me. Ayesha, please. I need you in my life. But I need him too. Can you accept that? Can you keep our secret and still be my sister?"

The bathroom door banged open, making them both jump. Little Hiba ran in, saw them, and ran back out. "They're in here!" she called to someone.

"We need to get back on the bus," Areeba said quietly, still holding Ayesha's hands. "So I need an answer. Are you with us? Or against us?"

Ayesha looked at her sister, at the determination in her eyes, the set of her jaw, the way she stood like someone ready to fight for what she loved. This wasn't the uncertain, anxious Areeba who'd boarded the bus in Lahore days ago.

This was someone new. Someone stronger. Someone who'd found power in the strangest, most impossible place.

And despite everything—despite the wrongness of it, the danger, the absolute insanity—Ayesha couldn't bring herself to destroy that.

"I won't tell," she finally said. "I won't support this. I won't say it's okay or good or right. But I won't tell."

Relief flooded Areeba's face. "Thank you. Thank you, Ayesha. I promise you won't regret—"

"I already regret it," Ayesha cut her off, pulling her hands free. "But you're right. It's your choice. Your body. Your life. So I'll keep your secret. Both of your secrets."

She turned and walked out of the bathroom before Areeba could respond. Before she could change her mind. Before the tears that threatened could actually fall.

Outside, the family was loading back onto the bus. Uncle Jamil was doing another headcount. The driver was checking something on his phone.

Ayesha climbed aboard and took her seat, staring resolutely out the window.

A moment later, Areeba slid into the seat beside her.

"Ayesha—"

"I don't want to talk about it anymore," Ayesha said, her voice flat. "You made your choice. I'll keep your secret. That's all there is to say."

Areeba was quiet for a long moment. Then, so softly Ayesha almost didn't hear it: "He says thank you too. For keeping us safe."

Ayesha closed her eyes and didn't respond.

The bus rumbled to life and pulled back onto the highway, leaving the mountains behind. Leaving Naran behind. Carrying them back toward Lahore, toward normal life, toward the impossible task of hiding the supernatural in the mundane.

In the seat beside Ayesha, Areeba resumed her quiet conversation with the spirit sharing her body. Making plans. Discussing strategies for hiding in plain sight. Two beings learning to navigate the world as one.

And Ayesha stared out the window and wondered if her silence made her complicit. If by choosing not to tell, she was choosing to enable something that might destroy them all.

But what choice did she have? Tell the family and lose her sister's trust forever? Watch them try to "fix" Areeba, maybe hurt her in the process? Risk Faisal becoming dangerous if cornered?

No. The only choice was to watch. To wait. To be ready to act if—when—things went wrong.

Because they would go wrong. Ayesha was certain of it.

Things this impossible, this unnatural, always went wrong eventually.

The bus drove on through the afternoon, carrying its passengers away from the mountains where the veil between worlds grew thin, back toward the city where impossible things couldn't happen.

Except they had happened.

And they were coming home.
