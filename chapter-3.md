# CHAPTER 3: SOMETHING BORROWED

Morning light crept through the thin curtains of Room 9, turning everything a pale, watery gold. Ayesha woke to the sound of the azaan echoing from the mosque down the street, the call to prayer mixing with the ever-present rush of the Kunhar River. For a blissful moment, she forgot about yesterday's terror.

Then she remembered.

She sat up quickly, her eyes going immediately to Areeba's bed.

Empty.

Panic seized her chest, but then she heard the toilet flush, and the bathroom door opened. Aunt Fareeda emerged, already dressed in a fresh shalwar kameez, her dupatta neatly pinned.

"Good morning," she said quietly, careful not to wake Aunt Sadia, who was still snoring softly in the bed by the window. "Sleep well?"

"How's Areeba?" Ayesha asked instead of answering.

Aunt Fareeda glanced at the fourth bed, where Areeba lay curled on her side, still deeply asleep. "She didn't wake once. Not even for Fajr. I checked her breathing twice." She lowered her voice even more. "Maybe she just needed rest. Yesterday was... stressful."

Stressful. That was one word for it.

Ayesha slipped out of bed, her joints stiff from yesterday's long bus ride. The wooden floor was cold against her bare feet. She gathered her clothes and toiletries and headed for the bathroom, trying to shake off the unease that had settled into her bones.

The shower was barely lukewarm, the water pressure weak, but Ayesha stood under it longer than necessary, letting it wash away yesterday's fear. By the time she emerged, dressed, hair damp and braided, face fresh, Aunt Sadia was awake and the room had filled with the quiet bustle of morning routines.

Areeba was still asleep.

"Should we wake her?" Aunt Sadia asked, applying moisturizer from a small jar. "The men want to leave for Saif-ul-Malook by nine."

"Let her rest a bit longer," Aunt Fareeda said. "After yesterday."

A sudden movement from Areeba's bed cut her off.

Areeba sat bolt upright, so abruptly it made all three women jump. Her hair was wild around her face, her dupatta tangled around her neck, her eyes wide and bright.

"Good morning!" she announced, her voice cheerful and loud in the quiet room.

Ayesha blinked. After three fainting spells and a night of what should have been fitful sleep, Areeba sounded like she'd just returned from a spa vacation. Energized. Almost manic.

"Beta," Aunt Fareeda said carefully, "how are you feeling?"

"Feeling?" Areeba stretched her arms above her head, arching her back like a cat. "Amazing! Absolutely amazing!" She looked down at herself, at her wrinkled clothes, her bare feet, and laughed. A strange, delighted laugh. "Wow... I'm still dressed. I slept in my clothes!" She ran her hands down her arms, her sides, as if rediscovering her own body. "This is... wow."

Ayesha exchanged a glance with her aunts. Aunt Sadia's expression was wary. Aunt Fareeda's smile was uncertain.

"Well," Aunt Fareeda said slowly, "I'm glad you're feeling better. We were very worried."

"Worried?" Areeba swung her legs off the bed and stood, swaying slightly before finding her balance. She walked to the small mirror mounted on the wall, her steps careful, deliberate. "Why worried?"

"You fainted," Aunt Sadia said flatly. "Three times. Yesterday. Do you remember?"

Areeba stared at her reflection, tilting her head one way, then the other. She touched her face, her cheeks, her nose, her lips, with the same exploratory curiosity a child might use. "Fainted," she repeated, but the word sounded empty of meaning. Then she smiled, a wide, bright smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. "But I'm fine now! Look at me!" She spread her arms. "Looking amazing, right?"

The phrasing was odd. Not "don't I look" or "I look" but "looking amazing" like she was narrating herself. Like she was trying out phrases she'd heard but didn't quite understand.

Ayesha felt that cold sensation return to her stomach.

"You look tired," she said carefully. "You should rest more."

"Rest?" Areeba laughed again, that same too-bright sound. "No, no, no. Today is for fun! Family trip, right?" She turned from the mirror and her eyes landed on Ayesha, and something in her expression shifted. Brightened. "Ayesha!"

Before Ayesha could react, Areeba crossed the room in three long strides and pulled her into a crushing embrace. Her arms wrapped around Ayesha's shoulders, squeezing tight, her face buried in Ayesha's neck.

"You smell amazing," Areeba breathed, her voice muffled against Ayesha's skin.

Ayesha went rigid. Areeba was touchy sometimes, they all were, it was normal for cousins, but this felt wrong. Too tight. Too intense. Too familiar. Areeba was inhaling deeply, like she was memorizing Ayesha's scent.

"Okay, that's..." Ayesha pushed her away, forcing a laugh to cover her discomfort. "Okay, calm down. Go get ready. We're leaving soon."

Areeba stepped back, still smiling that strange smile. "Ready? Oh! Yes! Ready!" She looked around the room as if seeing it for the first time. Her small suitcase lay beside her bed, still closed. "Where... where are my clothes?"

"In your suitcase, obviously," Aunt Sadia said, her tone sharpening with concern. "Are you sure you're feeling alright?"

"Perfect! I told you, perfect!" Areeba knelt beside her suitcase and opened it, staring at the contents with visible confusion. She pulled out a purple kameez, examined it, put it back. Pulled out a pair of jeans, frowned at them, put them back. Like she was looking at artifacts from an alien culture.

Ayesha watched, her unease growing. Areeba was meticulous about her clothes. She'd spent twenty minutes last week showing Ayesha her planned outfits for this trip, coordinated down to the accessories.

"Do you need help?" Aunt Fareeda offered.

"No!" Areeba's response was sharp, defensive. Then she softened, that smile returning. "No, thank you. I can... I'll figure it out."

She grabbed clothes seemingly at random, a green kameez that clashed with orange embroidered pants, a purple dupatta, and disappeared into the bathroom.

The three women left in the room looked at each other.

"That was strange," Aunt Sadia said quietly.

"She's probably still disoriented," Aunt Fareeda said, but she didn't sound convinced. "Maybe the fainting... maybe it affected her somehow."

Ayesha said nothing. She was thinking about yesterday. About that moment on the landing when Areeba had examined her own hand like it belonged to a stranger.

From the bathroom came the sound of running water. Then humming, off-key and tuneless, like someone who'd never heard music trying to imitate it.

Ayesha had never heard Areeba hum like that.

Ten minutes passed. Fifteen. The men knocked on the door, were they ready? Almost, Aunt Fareeda called back. Just a few more minutes.

Finally, the bathroom door opened.

Areeba emerged and Ayesha's eyebrows shot up.

Her cousin's outfit was a disaster, the clashing colors somehow even worse in combination, the dupatta draped crookedly over one shoulder. But it was her face that made Ayesha stare. Areeba wore no makeup. None. Not even the tinted lip balm she usually applied, or the kajal she never left the room without.

Her hair hung loose and uncombed, wild waves falling past her shoulders, still tangled from sleep.

"I'm ready!" Areeba announced proudly.

Aunt Sadia's mouth opened, then closed. Aunt Fareeda blinked rapidly.

Ayesha found her voice first. "At least tie your hair."

Areeba's hand went to her hair, running through the tangles. She looked confused. "Tie it?"

"Yes. You know. A ponytail? A braid? Something?" Ayesha gestured to her own neatly braided hair. "We're going to the lake. It'll be windy."

Areeba stared at her, then at Aunt Fareeda's carefully pinned dupatta, then at Aunt Sadia's neat bun. Understanding seemed to dawn, but it was followed immediately by something that looked almost like panic.

"I..." Areeba's voice dropped. "I don't know how to."

The room fell silent. Even the sounds from outside, the bazaar waking up, the river's rush—seemed to fade.

"What?" Ayesha said.

"I don't know how to tie my hair." Areeba was still smiling, but there was a brittleness to it now. A crack in the performance. "Can you... can you show me?"

Aunt Sadia laughed, sharp and disbelieving. "Very funny, beta. Now seriously, fix yourself. We're late."

But Areeba wasn't laughing. She just stood there, hair wild, clothes mismatched, staring at them with an expression that was equal parts helpless and defiant.

"You don't know how to tie your hair," Ayesha repeated slowly. "You. The girl who spent two hours on YouTube learning a fishtail braid. The girl who literally taught me how to do a proper bun."

Something flickered across Areeba's face, fear, maybe, or confusion. "I... I forgot?"

"You forgot." The words fell flat.

"Maybe from the fainting," Aunt Fareeda said quickly, jumping in. "Head trauma can cause temporary memory issues. I saw it on a show once."

"I didn't hit my head that hard," Ayesha cut her off, her eyes never leaving Areeba. "Did you?"

"I don't remember!" Areeba's voice rose, taking on a desperate edge. "I don't remember hitting anything! I don't remember fainting! I don't." She stopped abruptly, her hands clenched into fists. Then, more quietly: "Please. Can someone just... help me?"

The vulnerability in that request should have softened Ayesha. Should have made her feel guilty for being suspicious. But instead, it sent ice down her spine. Because Areeba didn't sound like someone who'd temporarily forgotten a skill.

She sounded like someone who'd never known it in the first place.

"Come here," Ayesha said finally.

Areeba approached cautiously, almost shyly. Ayesha guided her to sit on the bed and stood behind her, gathering the dark waves of hair in her hands. It was coarse with dried sweat and yesterday's dust.

"When did you last wash your hair?" Ayesha asked.

"I... I don't..." Areeba trailed off.

Ayesha began braiding, her fingers working automatically through the familiar motions. French braid, tight and neat. Behind Areeba's head, safe from view, Ayesha let her expression show what she was feeling. Worry. Confusion. And something deeper. Something cold.

Because Areeba sat perfectly still, her posture straight, barely breathing. Like she'd never had her hair braided before. Like she didn't know this was something cousins did for each other all the time.

Like she didn't know who Ayesha was.

"There," Ayesha said, tying off the braid with an elastic from her wrist. "Done."

Areeba reached back, touching the braid with wonder. "It feels... strange."

"It's a braid, not a surgical procedure," Aunt Sadia muttered, gathering her purse. "Now can we please go? The men have knocked three times."

Areeba stood and went to the mirror again. She turned her head side to side, examining the braid like it was the most fascinating thing she'd ever seen. "You're very skilled," she said to Ayesha's reflection. "Thank you."

You're very skilled. Not "thanks, you're the best" or even just "thanks." Formal. Distant. Like thanking a stranger for directions.

Ayesha opened her mouth to respond, to say what, she didn't know—but another knock interrupted.

"LADIES!" Uncle Jamil's voice boomed through the door. "We're going to miss the entire morning!"

"Coming!" Aunt Fareeda called. She ushered everyone toward the door, grabbing bags and dupatta pins and water bottles. The small room erupted into organized chaos.

Ayesha hung back, watching Areeba. Her cousin moved through the flurry with an odd carefulness, like she was navigating an obstacle course. She picked up a small purse, her own purse, which she'd carried yesterday, and stared at it for a long moment before slinging it over her shoulder.

Then she caught Ayesha watching and smiled. That same bright, empty smile.

"Today will be fun," Areeba said. Not a question. A statement. Like she was reading from a script.

"Yeah," Ayesha said quietly. "Fun."

But as they filed out of the room into the dim hallway, where the men were waiting with varying degrees of impatience, Ayesha made a decision.

She was going to watch Areeba. Closely. Every word, every movement, every strange moment.

Because whoever had woken up in that bed this morning...

Ayesha was becoming increasingly certain it wasn't her cousin.
