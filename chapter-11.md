# CHAPTER 11: NORMAL LIFE (ABNORMALLY LIVED)

Three days had passed since they'd returned to Lahore.

Three days of trying to pretend everything was normal. Three days of watching Areeba navigate life with a constant companion no one else could see. Three days of Ayesha keeping a secret that felt heavier with each passing hour.

Monday morning arrived with Lahore's typical chaos—traffic jams, honking rickshaws, the smell of exhaust mixing with street food. Ayesha and Areeba sat in the back of Farrukh's was about to about to drove them to NUST, the same route they'd taken hundreds of times before.

Except everything was different now.

"You have your assignment?" Faiza asked from the front seat, twisting around to look at Areeba. "The structures one that's due today?"

"Yes, Mama," Areeba said, patting her bag.

"And you studied for the quiz?"

"Yes, Mama."

"And you're feeling completely recovered? No more altitude sickness symptoms?"

"I'm fine, Mama. Really."

Faiza studied her daughter for a moment longer, then nodded. "You do look better. More color in your cheeks. The mountain air must have done you good."

*If only you knew what else the mountains did*, Ayesha thought darkly.

Areeba caught her eye and gave a small, guilty smile. Ayesha looked away.

The truth was, Areeba *did* look better. Healthier. More vibrant. Since making her decision to keep Faisal, she'd stopped looking haunted and started looking... alive. Energized. Like someone who'd found purpose.

It made Ayesha's stomach twist. Wrong things weren't supposed to make people look healthy.

Farrukh pulled up to the university gates. "Have a good day, girls. I'll pick you up at four."

They grabbed their bags and headed into campus, joining the stream of students flowing toward various departments. NUST's main campus was a sprawling complex of modern buildings, meticulously maintained lawns, and perpetually crowded walkways.

"You're still not talking to me," Areeba observed as they walked toward the Civil Engineering building.

"I'm talking to you."

"You're using words in my direction. That's not the same thing."

Ayesha adjusted her dupatta and kept walking. "What do you want me to say? 'Congratulations on your supernatural parasite?'"

"He's not a parasite." Areeba's voice had an edge. "And you said you wouldn't—"

"I said I wouldn't *tell*," Ayesha interrupted. "I didn't say I'd be happy about it."

They walked in tense silence for a few moments. Then Areeba spoke again, quieter. "He heard that. The parasite comment. It hurt his feelings."

"He's dead. He doesn't have feelings."

"Yes, he does. And that hurt too."

Ayesha stopped walking and turned to face her sister. Students flowed around them like water around stones. "Areeba, I'm trying. I really am. But this is—it's too much. It's too weird. And now we're back in real life with real people and real consequences, and I'm terrified every second that someone's going to notice—"

"No one will notice," Areeba said firmly. "We're being careful. Watch."

She raised her voice to normal volume and waved at a girl passing by. "Sana! Hi!"

Sana, one of their classmates, stopped and smiled. "Hey! How was your trip? I saw your Instagram stories—those mountains looked amazing!"

"It was incredible," Areeba said, and her voice was perfectly normal. Perfectly *her*. "You should go sometime. The lake is unreal."

"Maybe next summer. Hey, did you finish the assignment? I struggled with question three."

"Oh, the moment distribution one? Yeah, I figured it out. I can show you before class if you want."

"You're a lifesaver! Walk with me?"

Areeba glanced at Ayesha, who made a small gesture—*go ahead*. Areeba fell into step with Sana, chatting about the assignment with easy familiarity.

Ayesha followed a few steps behind, watching. Looking for signs. For slips. For anything that might give away the impossible truth.

But there was nothing. Areeba was just... Areeba. Maybe a little more confident in her stride. Maybe a little quicker with her smile. But nothing that would make anyone suspicious.

Maybe this could actually work.

Or maybe they were all just waiting for the other shoe to drop.

---

Their first class was Structural Analysis III with Dr. Raza, a notoriously difficult professor who took pleasure in cold-calling students and watching them squirm. The lecture hall was already half-full when they arrived, students scattered across the tiered seating.

Ayesha headed for their usual spot—middle section, three rows from the back, close enough to see but far enough to avoid constant attention. Areeba followed, with Sana still chattering beside her about the weekend.

They settled into their seats. Ayesha pulled out her notebook and pencil case with methodical precision, trying to focus on the familiar ritual of preparing for class. Normal things. Normal actions.

Areeba sat beside her, arranging her own materials. To anyone watching, she looked like any other student. But Ayesha noticed the small things—the way Areeba's lips moved slightly, like she was talking under her breath. The way her eyes would focus on empty air beside her, then refocus on her notebook. The small smile that crossed her face at random moments.

She was talking to him. Constantly. An ongoing conversation no one else could hear.

"Does he ever shut up?" Ayesha whispered.

Areeba blinked, coming back to external reality. "What?"

"Faisal. Does he ever just... not talk?"

"Sometimes. When I'm talking to other people, he usually stays quiet. Listens." Areeba paused. "He says you're grumpy today."

"I'm grumpy every day lately. Tell him he's welcome for the mood."

"He also says—" Areeba stopped herself, shaking her head. "Never mind."

"What?"

"He says he's sorry. For making things complicated. But he's not sorry enough to leave."

Ayesha opened her mouth to respond, but Dr. Raza strode into the lecture hall at that moment, cutting off all conversation. The professor was a small, sharp-eyed man in his fifties who wore his authority like armor.

"Good morning," he said, though his tone suggested the morning was anything but good. "I hope you all completed the reading on indeterminate structures. Because we're going to need that foundation for today's material."

He turned to the board and began writing equations in rapid, cramped handwriting. "Today we're discussing the moment distribution method for analyzing continuous beams. Who can tell me the fundamental principle behind this method?"

Silence. The students had learned early that volunteering in Dr. Raza's class was dangerous—he'd pick apart your answer even if it was correct.

Dr. Raza turned, surveying the room with predatory patience. "No one? Really? This was in the assigned reading."

More silence.

"Fine. Miss..." His eyes landed on someone in the front row. "Khadija. Fundamental principle. Go."

Khadija stammered through a partially correct answer. Dr. Raza listened with visible impatience, then cut her off mid-sentence.

"Close, but imprecise. The principle is that moments are distributed to connected members based on their relative stiffnesses until equilibrium is achieved. Who can tell me how we calculate the distribution factor?"

Again, silence.

This time, Areeba's hand went up.

Ayesha's head whipped around to stare at her sister. Areeba *never* volunteered. She was a decent student—solid B's and occasional A's—but she preferred to stay under the radar, especially in Dr. Raza's class.

Dr. Raza looked surprised too. "Miss... Areeba, isn't it? Go ahead."

"The distribution factor is calculated by dividing the stiffness of the member by the sum of stiffnesses of all members meeting at that joint," Areeba said clearly. "It's essentially the ratio of how much moment that particular member will absorb compared to the others."

Dr. Raza's eyebrows rose slightly. "Correct. And how does this relate to the carry-over factor?"

Without hesitation: "The carry-over factor is the proportion of the distributed moment that gets transmitted to the far end of the member. For a prismatic member with a fixed far end, it's typically one-half. For a pinned end, it's zero since pins can't resist moment."

"Very good. And what about—"

"If I may, sir," Areeba interrupted—another thing she never did—"the real elegance of the moment distribution method is that it's iterative. Each cycle of distribution and carry-over brings you closer to the true solution. It's particularly useful for complex frames where the force method would be computationally intensive."

The lecture hall had gone very quiet. Students were turning to look at Areeba, surprised by the sudden display of knowledge.

Dr. Raza was studying her with new interest. "You seem well-versed in this topic, Miss Areeba."

"I find the methodology intuitive," Areeba said. Then she added, almost absently, "When you think about buildings as living systems, the way forces flow through them makes more sense. Each member in dialogue with the others, finding balance together."

*Buildings as living systems.* That wasn't textbook language. That was... architectural language.

Ayesha's eyes widened. *Faisal.*

"An interesting perspective," Dr. Raza said. "Tell me, what are the limitations of the moment distribution method?"

"It's best suited for beams and frames under fixed loading," Areeba replied immediately. "For moving loads or dynamic analysis, you'd need other approaches. And while it's elegant for hand calculations, it's less efficient than matrix methods for computer analysis. Though personally, I think there's value in the hand calculation process—it builds intuition about structural behavior that you lose when you just plug numbers into software."

Dr. Raza actually smiled. It was a small smile, but on his usually stern face, it was significant. "I couldn't agree more. Too many students these days rely entirely on SAP2000 without understanding the underlying principles."

He turned back to the board and continued the lecture, but he kept directing questions to Areeba throughout. And she answered every single one perfectly, often elaborating with insights that went beyond the textbook.

Around them, students were whispering.

"Since when is Areeba so good at this?"

"She's never been this sharp before..."

"Maybe she actually studied for once."

In the row ahead of them, a guy turned around— Rizwan, one of the top students in their class. He was conventionally handsome, always well-dressed, and generally considered a good catch by most of the female students.

"That was impressive," he said to Areeba when Dr. Raza paused to draw a diagram. "I didn't know you were so into structural theory."

Areeba smiled politely. "I've been doing extra reading."

"Clearly. Hey, a few of us are forming a study group for the final project. We could use someone with your understanding of—"

"No."

The word came out harder than Areeba's usual speaking voice. Sharper. Almost masculine.

Rizwan blinked. "Oh. Okay, no pressure. I just thought—"

"She said no." Areeba's voice was definitely different now—lower pitched, with an edge that made Rizwan lean back slightly. "She's not interested in your study group. Or your company. So you can turn back around and focus on the lecture."

Ayesha grabbed Areeba's arm under the desk, squeezing hard. *Faisal. That was Faisal.*

Rizwan's expression shifted from friendly to confused to offended. "I was just asking about studying, not—whatever you think—"

"Rizwan," Dr. Raza's voice cut across the room. "Is there a problem?"

"No, sir," Rizwan said quickly, turning back around. But his shoulders were tense, and he threw one more confused glance at Areeba before facing forward.

Beside Ayesha, Areeba's posture shifted slightly—less rigid, more natural. When she spoke, her whisper was back to her normal voice. "Sorry. He got... protective."

"*Protective?*" Ayesha hissed. "That was jealous! That was possessive! Areeba, he can't just—"

"I know. I told him. He's sorry."

"I don't care if he's sorry! You can't let him take over whenever a guy talks to you! That's—people will notice!"

"It won't happen again," Areeba whispered, but she didn't sound entirely convinced.

In front of them, Rizwan was still radiating confusion and hurt feelings. Around them, several students were shooting curious looks at Areeba.

*This is how it starts*, Ayesha thought grimly. *This is how people begin to notice something's wrong.*

Dr. Raza finished the lecture and assigned homework—three complex frame analysis problems using moment distribution. As students packed up their things, Ayesha noticed several people watching Areeba with new interest.

Sana leaned over. "Girl, what was *that* about? You totally shut down Rizwan."

"He caught me off guard," Areeba said, her voice carefully neutral. "I'm not good with being put on the spot."

"He was just asking about studying together."

"I prefer to study alone."

"Since when? We literally studied together last week—"

"I mean for the final project. I work better independently on big things." Areeba was recovering, smoothing over the strangeness with reasonable explanations. "And I didn't mean to sound harsh. Can you tell him I'm sorry if I was rude?"

"Tell him yourself," Sana said, but not unkindly. "Come on, we have Materials next."

They gathered their things and filed out of the lecture hall. In the corridor, Ayesha pulled Areeba aside while other students flowed past them.

"We need to talk about what just happened."

"I know."

"He can't do that. He can't just take over because he doesn't like a guy talking to you."

"I *know*." Areeba looked frustrated. "We're still figuring out the boundaries. It's only been a few days—"

"You don't have the luxury of figuring it out slowly," Ayesha interrupted. "Every time he does something like that, it's another person who might notice something's off. Another crack in your cover."

"I'll talk to him. Set clearer rules."

"Can you even do that? Can you control when he takes over?"

Areeba hesitated. "Mostly. If I'm aware and pushing back, I can stop him. But when I'm distracted or if he feels strongly about something, it's harder."

"So basically, any time he gets jealous, he can just hijack your body."

"It's not—" Areeba stopped, took a breath. "It's more complicated than that. We're learning to communicate better. To ask before taking control instead of just doing it. But yes, strong emotions make it harder for both of us to maintain boundaries."

Ayesha rubbed her temples, feeling a headache forming. "This is insane. You know that, right? This whole situation is completely insane."

"I know." Areeba's voice was small. "But it's my insane situation. And I'm making it work."

"Are you? Because from where I'm standing, you almost just blew your cover in front of thirty people."

Before Areeba could respond, Rizwan appeared from around a corner, clearly having waited for them. He approached cautiously, like someone approaching a potentially aggressive animal.

"Hey, Areeba. Can I talk to you for a second?"

Areeba's entire body tensed. Ayesha could see it—the subtle shift in posture, the way her shoulders squared, the slight tilt of her chin. Faisal, getting ready to defend his territory.

"Areeba," Ayesha said quietly, urgently. "Stay with me. Don't let him—"

"I've got it," Areeba whispered back. Then, to Rizwan, in a carefully controlled normal voice: "Sure. What's up?"

"I just wanted to apologize if I made you uncomfortable," Rizwan said. "I wasn't trying to—I mean, I just thought since you seemed really knowledgeable, you'd be a good addition to the study group. That's all. I wasn't trying to hit on you or anything."

Ayesha watched Areeba's face carefully. She could see the micro-expressions shifting—Areeba's natural empathy and politeness fighting with Faisal's territorial instincts.

"It's okay," Areeba finally said, and her voice was her own. "I overreacted. I'm sorry for being harsh. It's been a weird morning."

"No worries." Rizwan smiled, relieved. "So, about the study group—no pressure, but the offer stands if you change your mind. It's me, Bilal, Zara, and Amna. We're meeting Wednesday evenings at the library."

Ayesha saw Areeba's jaw clench slightly—Faisal, pushing to say no. But Areeba maintained control.

"Thanks for the offer. I'll think about it."

"Cool." Rizwan nodded and headed off to his next class.

As soon as he was out of earshot, Areeba let out a long breath. "That was harder than it should have been."

"He wanted you to shut him down again."

"Yes. He's very..." Areeba searched for the word. "Insistent. About other guys."

"Areeba, that's not romantic. That's a red flag. That's controlling behavior—"

"It's protective—"

"It's possessive," Ayesha corrected firmly. "And you need to establish right now that he doesn't get to control who you talk to or how you interact with people. Because that's not partnership. That's him using you."

Areeba's expression shuttered. "You don't understand what we have."

"I understand that a jealous spirit is controlling your body against your will."

"It's not against my will—"

"Then why did you have to fight to stay in control just now?" Ayesha demanded. "Why was it 'harder than it should have been' to simply have a polite conversation?"

Areeba didn't answer. Around them, the corridor was emptying as students headed to their next classes.

"We're going to be late for Materials," Areeba finally said, deflecting.

"Areeba—"

"Please, Ayesha. Just... not now. Okay?" There was exhaustion in her voice. "I'll talk to him. I promise. We'll set better boundaries. But I can't do this right now. I need to get through the day first."

Ayesha wanted to push. Wanted to drag her sister somewhere private and have it out—force her to see the danger she was in. But the defeated slump of Areeba's shoulders stopped her.

"Fine," Ayesha said. "But we're talking tonight. Really talking. About rules and boundaries and what happens if he can't control his jealousy."

"Okay."

They hurried to their next class, sliding into seats just as the professor began. Materials Science was normally one of Areeba's better subjects, but today she seemed distracted, her attention split between the lecture and her internal conversation.

Ayesha watched her sister throughout the class. Watched the small movements of her lips. The distant look that would cross her face. The small smiles at invisible jokes.

Two people sharing one body.

And Ayesha was the only one who knew.

The only one who could see the cracks forming.

The only one who could stop this before it spiraled completely out of control.

But watching Areeba—seeing the way she'd light up during those internal conversations, the confidence that seemed to flow through her when Faisal was helping her, the way she looked more *alive* than she had in years—Ayesha had to confront an uncomfortable truth.

Areeba was happy.

Wrong, impossible, supernatural situation aside—Areeba was genuinely happy.

And what kind of person would Ayesha be if she destroyed that?

Even if she was certain that eventually, inevitably, it would destroy Areeba first?
