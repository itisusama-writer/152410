# CHAPTER 1 - THE ROAD TO NARAN

The coaster bus groaned as it climbed another winding turn, its engine straining against the incline. Inside, the smell of diesel fumes mixed with the floral sweetness of someone's perfume and the sharp tang of oranges being peeled three rows back. Areeba pressed her forehead against the cold metal railing of the seat in front of her, trying to find relief from the pressure building behind her eyes.

"You okay?" her Aunt Fareeda asked, adjusting the dupatta that kept sliding off her shoulder. She sat wedged between Areeba and the window, occasionally pointing out scenery nobody could properly see through the dust-filmed glass.

"Just a headache," Areeba mumbled, not lifting her head. The railing felt like ice against her skin, a small mercy in the stuffy bus. Outside, the Punjab plains had given way to rocky terrain, the landscape transforming with every kilometer that brought them closer to Naran.

Across the aisle, her sister Ayesha was scrolling through her phone, trying to catch the last bars of signal before they ventured deeper into the mountains. The rest of the family, Uncle Jamil, Aunt Sadia, and the kids, occupied the seats behind them, their chatter creating a constant buzz of excitement.

"Lahore seems like days ago already," Aunt Fareeda said, fanning herself with a magazine. "These trips always feel longer than they are."

Areeba didn't respond. The headache had sharpened into something else, a strange hollowness spreading through her limbs. The bus hit a pothole, and the jolt sent a wave of nausea through her stomach. She kept her forehead pressed to the railing, her breathing shallow.

The pressure built. And built.

And then, nothing.

---

"Areeba?"

The voice sounded distant, muffled, like someone calling from underwater.

"Areeba!"

Louder now. Sharper.

Ayesha looked up from her phone, her thumb frozen mid-scroll. She'd heard Aunt Fareeda call her sister's name three times now, each repetition climbing in pitch. Something in that tone made her stomach tighten.

"What's wrong?" Ayesha asked, pulling out her earbuds.

Aunt Fareeda's face had gone pale. "She's not answering." Her hand hovered over Areeba's shoulder, uncertain. "I thought she was just sleeping, butâ€”"

"Areeba!" Ayesha leaned across the aisle, her voice cutting through the ambient noise of the bus. The chatter behind them stuttered, then died.

No response.

Aunt Fareeda grabbed Areeba's shoulder and pulled her upright. Her niece's head lolled backward, boneless, her eyes rolled up so only the whites showed. A thin line of saliva glistened at the corner of her slack mouth.

"Ya Allah!" Aunt Sadia gasped from the seat behind.

The bus suddenly felt too small, the air too thick. Aunt Fareeda's hands trembled as she shook Areeba's shoulders. "Beta! Beta, wake up!"

Nothing. Areeba was completely motionless, a ragdoll in her aunt's arms.

"What happened? What's going on?" Uncle Jamil pushed forward, his bulky frame blocking the narrow aisle.

"She fainted!" Ayesha was already digging through her bag. "Does anyone have water?"

A bottle appeared, thrust forward by shaking hands. Aunt Fareeda unscrewed it with fumbling fingers, water sloshing over the rim. She sprinkled it on Areeba's face, once, twice, three times. The droplets rolled down her niece's cheeks like tears, but Areeba remained still as stone.

"More water!" Uncle Jamil commanded. "Driver, stop the bus!"

"I can't stop here, sahib!" the driver called back, not taking his eyes off the twisting road. "There's no shoulder. We're fifteen minutes from the rest stop!"

"Then drive faster!" Aunt Sadia's voice cracked.

Ayesha dampened her dupatta and pressed it against Areeba's forehead, her own heart hammering against her ribs. Her sister's skin felt wrong, too cold, too clammy. "Areeba, come on. Wake up. *Please.*"

The bus careened around another bend. Someone in the back was reciting Ayat al-Kursi, the prayer barely audible over the engine's roar.

Then...

Areeba's eyelids fluttered.

A collective breath released.

Her eyes opened slowly, unfocused, pupils dilated and dark. She blinked once, twice, looking around at the circle of frightened faces hovering over her as if she'd never seen them before.

"What..." Her voice came out hoarse, confused. "What happened?"

"You fainted, beta!" Aunt Fareeda's relief came out as anger. "You scared us half to death! What's wrong with you?"

Areeba's hand drifted to her forehead. The wet dupatta slid off, landing in her lap. "I don't... I don't know. I just felt dizzy and then..." She trailed off, her brow furrowing.

"When did you eat last?" Uncle Jamil demanded. "Did you have breakfast?"

"I... yes. I had parathas. And chai." Areeba tried to sit up straighter, but Aunt Fareeda held her shoulder.

"Easy, easy. Don't move too fast."

"Maybe it's car sickness," Ayesha offered, though she didn't sound convinced. "The roads are pretty bad."

"Or dehydration," Uncle Jamil said, nodding as if he'd diagnosed the problem. "These long trips, people forget to drink water. Here..." He pushed the bottle into Areeba's hands. "Drink."

Areeba obeyed, taking small sips. Color was slowly returning to her face, the awful grayish tint fading. Around them, the other passengers were settling back into their seats, the crisis apparently over. The bus rumbled on.

"You feel better now?" Aunt Fareeda asked, searching her niece's face.

"Yes." Areeba managed a weak smile. "I'm fine. Really. Sorry for scaring everyone."

But Ayesha noticed the way her sister's hands trembled as she held the water bottle. And the way her eyes kept darting to the window, as if looking for something in the passing landscape.

---

Twenty minutes later, the incident had faded into family lore. Uncle Jamil was already retelling it with embellishments ("I thought we'd lost her!"), and the kids were giggling again in the back. Areeba insisted she felt fine, and gradually, the normalcy of the trip reasserted itself.

They played word games. They sang old film songs, slightly off-key. They argued good-naturedly about which hotel in Naran had the best breakfast. The mountains grew taller, more imposing, their peaks disappearing into low-hanging clouds.

Areeba even laughed at Uncle Jamil's terrible jokes, though Ayesha thought the laughter sounded forced, brittle at the edges.

When the bus finally pulled into a gas station, a squat concrete building with sun-faded signs advertising Pepsi and cigarettes, everyone groaned with relief.

"Finally!" Aunt Sadia gathered her purse. "I need to stretch my legs before they fall off."

"Toilet break!" one of the kids announced unnecessarily.

The driver killed the engine, and the sudden silence felt profound after hours of mechanical rumbling. Passengers shuffled toward the exit, joints cracking, backs aching. The air outside would be fresher, cleaner, tinged with pine and mountain cold.

Ayesha stood and stretched, her spine popping. Areeba rose beside her, moving carefully, as if testing her own stability.

"You sure you're okay?" Ayesha asked quietly.

"I told you, I'm fine." Areeba's tone had an edge to it. "Stop worrying."

They filed off the bus with the other women, Aunt Fareeda, Aunt Sadia, and a couple of family members. The men headed toward the small mosque adjacent to the gas station. The children scattered like birds, thrilled to be free from confinement.

The gas station sat at the edge of a valley, surrounded by rocky hills that would soon become proper mountains. The air was noticeably cooler here, crisp and thin. Ayesha inhaled deeply, grateful to fill her lungs with something other than recycled bus air.

"The toilets are around back," Aunt Sadia said, wrinkling her nose. "Hopefully they're not too terrible."

They walked as a group across the cracked concrete, their footsteps echoing. Somewhere, a radio played tinny music. The gas station attendant watched them with disinterested eyes while manually pumping fuel into the bus.

Areeba walked beside Ayesha, her sandals scuffing against the ground.

Three steps.

Four.

Five.

Ayesha heard it before she saw it, a sound like a sack of rice hitting concrete.

She turned.

Areeba was on the ground.

Not stumbling. Not kneeling. Fully collapsed, her body crumpled at an impossible angle, her head turned to the side, her eyes open but seeing nothing.

For a frozen moment, no one moved. The mountain wind whistled through the valley, cold and indifferent.
