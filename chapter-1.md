# **Chapter 1: The Console**

The winter morning arrived in shades of silver and pearl, the sun barely cresting the horizon as Rimsha Rizvi hurried across the courtyard of the University of Lahore. Her breath formed small clouds in the frigid air, dissipating as quickly as her footsteps on the frost-touched pavement. She pulled her dupatta tighter around her shoulders, the deep maroon fabric doing little against the knife-edge of the wind.

Eight-fifteen. She was early—unusual for a Monday, but her mind had been restless all night. Dreams she couldn't quite remember had left her uneasy, so she'd abandoned sleep for the familiar comfort of routine.

The campus felt different at this hour. Empty. The pale light cast long shadows from the eucalyptus trees, and the usual chaos of students hadn't yet descended. Only the distant clang of the chai vendor setting up his stall and the lonely caw of crows broke the silence. Rimsha's sneakers squeaked against the polished floor as she entered the medical sciences building, the sound echoing through corridors that seemed cavernous without the usual press of bodies.

Section A2 was on the third floor. She took the stairs two at a time, her backpack heavy with anatomy textbooks and the weight of approaching exams. The stairwell smelled of floor cleaner and something else—dampness, maybe, from the overnight cold seeping through old walls.

The classroom door stood ajar.

Warm air spilled out, a blessed relief, along with the sound of quiet conversation. Rimsha pushed inside to find only five other students scattered among the rows of desks. Sana sat in their usual spot by the window, her headscarf a bright turquoise that defied the gray morning.

"You're early," Sana said, looking up from her phone with surprise. "Are you feeling okay?"

"Couldn't sleep." Rimsha slid into the seat beside her, dropping her bag with a thud. "Where is everyone?"

"Winter fog delayed the campus shuttle. Professor Malik sent a message—class starts at nine instead of eight-thirty." Sana tilted her head, studying Rimsha with the keen attention of a best friend. "You look pale. More than usual, I mean."

"Thanks," Rimsha said dryly, but she rubbed her hands together, trying to work warmth back into her fingers. Through the window, the campus spread below them, still draped in wisps of morning mist. The cricket ground was barely visible, its boundary fence emerging like ghosts from white.

The classroom's fluorescent lights hummed overhead, that perpetual electrical drone that became white noise after a while. Someone had tried to make the space cheerful—posters of the human circulatory system competed for wall space with a faded motivational quote about doctors being angels in disguise. The quote had always made Rimsha uncomfortable. She didn't feel like an angel. Most days, she barely felt competent.

"Did you finish the neurology reading?" Sana asked, pulling out her notes.

Rimsha nodded, reaching for her own notebook, when movement outside the classroom caught her eye.

Two figures in the corridor. Men. They moved with purpose, heads turning to peer through each classroom door window as they passed. Dark jackets, hood-like collars turned up. Something about their posture—tense, hunting—made Rimsha's stomach tighten.

"What's wrong?" Sana followed her gaze.

"I don't know. They just seem..." Rimsha trailed off. The university had visitors all the time. Guest lecturers, administrative staff, maintenance workers. But these men didn't carry themselves like they belonged here. And they were coming closer.

The few other students in the room were absorbed in their phones or textbooks, oblivious. The clock on the wall ticked loudly. Eight-forty-three.

The footsteps stopped.

Right outside their door.

Rimsha's heart began to hammer against her ribs, a warning that felt both primitive and oddly specific. Through the small rectangular window in the door, she saw a face appear—sharp features, dark eyes scanning the room with mechanical precision. The door handle turned.

"Good morning," said a voice that carried no warmth. "We're looking for someone."

Both men entered, and the temperature in the room seemed to drop. They were younger than Rimsha had first thought—maybe late twenties—but their faces held a hardness that had nothing to do with age. The taller one had a scar above his left eyebrow, barely visible. The other's jaw worked methodically on what might have been gum.

"Can we help you?" asked Hamza, a third-year student sitting near the front. His voice held the uncertain friendliness of someone trying to defuse strangeness with politeness.

Neither man looked at him. Their eyes locked onto Rimsha.

"You," said the scarred one, pointing. "Rimsha Rizvi."

The use of her full name, spoken with flat certainty, sent ice through her veins. Sana's hand found hers under the desk, squeezing hard.

"I... yes?" Rimsha's voice came out smaller than she wanted. Her mind was suddenly racing, fragments of thought colliding—*how did they find me, they shouldn't know, I was careful—* She forced the spiral to stop. "Who are you?"

"We need to talk to you. Outside." It wasn't a request.

"About what?" She tried to stand but found her legs unreliable. The other students were staring now, conversations died, the atmosphere thick with tension.

"About what you took," the second man said, his jaw still working that rhythmic chew. "We just want it back. No trouble."

Rimsha's throat went dry. She kept her face carefully neutral, the same expression she used during oral exams when she wasn't sure of an answer. "I don't know what you're talking about," she said, and was grateful her voice didn't shake. "I haven't taken anything."

It was true, in a way. She hadn't taken it. Not exactly.

The scarred man took a step closer, and Rimsha's carefully controlled facade cracked. Her instincts screamed. She shot to her feet, the desk screeching against the floor.

"Come on," Sana hissed, pulling her toward the back of the classroom. There was a second door there, leading to the storage area—maybe they could—

"Don't make this difficult," the second man said, moving faster now, cutting off the angle.

Rimsha stumbled backward, her hip catching the corner of a desk. Pain flared, sharp and sudden, causing her to gasp. She twisted, reaching for balance, and her ankle rolled beneath her. The floor rushed up and she landed hard on her side, the impact jarring her shoulder and skinning her palm against rough tile.

"Rimsha!" Sana dropped beside her.

"We don't have time for this." The scarred man loomed over them now, and Rimsha could smell cigarette smoke clinging to his jacket. "Where is the console? We know your brother gave it to you."

The word—*console*—hit her like a physical blow. Her brother's face flashed in her mind, that last video call, the strange intensity in his eyes when he'd said *keep it safe, don't tell anyone, I'll explain everything soon.* That had been four days ago.

"My brother?" Rimsha heard herself say, and she pushed genuine confusion into her voice. It wasn't hard—she *was* confused about so many things. Just not about what they were asking for. "He didn't give me anything! I don't know what console you mean!"

The lie tasted bitter, but she held the scarred man's gaze. Her medical training had taught her to project calm in emergencies. She used every bit of that training now.

"She's lying," the second man said, but there was doubt in his voice. He was looking at her not like a thief, but like someone who might genuinely be confused. "Check her bag."

"No!" Rimsha clutched her backpack to her chest—a reflex that was at least honest. The console wasn't in there, but she couldn't let them search her things. Couldn't let them find anything that might lead them to—

The scarred man bent down, reaching—

A phone rang.

The sound was absurdly normal—a generic ringtone—but it shattered the moment like glass. The scarred man straightened, pulling a cell phone from his pocket. He glanced at the screen and his jaw tightened.

"Yes?" A pause. His eyes never left Rimsha's face. "Understood. Yes. We're here now." Another pause, longer. His expression shifted—frustration, maybe calculation. "Confirmed. We'll return."

He ended the call.

The two men looked at each other, some wordless communication passing between them. Rimsha's palm stung where she'd scraped it, and her shoulder throbbed, but she forced herself to stay still, every muscle locked. Her mind was already working, calculating—*how much time do I have, where is it safe, can I move it before—*

"You have until tonight," the scarred man said finally, his voice dropping to something almost conversational, which somehow made it more terrifying. "Find the console. We know you have it, or you know where it is. Don't try to run. Don't go to the police. We'll know."

Rimsha's breath caught—a tiny hitch she couldn't control. Had he seen something in her face? Some flicker of recognition?

"But I don't—" she started.

"Tonight," he repeated. "We'll be watching, Rimsha Rizvi. Don't make us come back the hard way."

They left as quickly as they'd arrived, their footsteps receding down the corridor with eerie synchronization. The classroom door swung shut with a soft click that seemed deafening in the sudden silence.

For a long moment, nobody moved. Then Hamza stood shakily, went to the door, and locked it.

"What," Sana whispered, helping Rimsha sit up, "was *that*?"

Rimsha looked down at her trembling hands—the shaking was real enough, fear mixed with something else she couldn't name—at the small scrape across her palm starting to bead with blood. Her medical training noted distantly that it was superficial, nothing serious. But the terror squeezing her chest had nothing to do with physical injury.

"I have no idea," she said, and the words felt like ash in her mouth. She forced herself to meet Sana's eyes, to look as lost and frightened as her friend expected. "I swear to God, Sana, I have no idea what they're talking about."

The oath sat heavy on her conscience, but what else could she say? Aamir had been clear: *trust no one.*

Outside the window, the sun had finally burned through the mist, flooding the campus with clear, cold light. Students were beginning to arrive for the nine o'clock classes, walking in laughing groups, clutching coffee cups, gloriously unaware.

And somewhere among them, Rimsha knew with sick certainty, those men were watching.

Waiting.

For something she couldn't give them. Wouldn't give them. Even if she didn't fully understand why.

The clock ticked toward nine, each second a countdown. Professor Malik would arrive soon. Class would begin. Everyone would pretend this was a normal Monday morning.

But Rimsha's phone felt suddenly heavy in her pocket. She pulled it out with shaking fingers—partly for show, partly because she needed to know—and opened her messages. Nothing from Aamir in three days. Not since that last cryptic video call.

*Keep it safe. Don't tell anyone. I'll explain everything soon.*

"Call your brother," Sana said, watching her. "Right now."

Rimsha nodded, throat tight, and dialed. She knew, somehow, what would happen before it did.

It rang once. Twice. Three times.

Then a message: *The number you have dialed is currently switched off.*

She tried again, her fingers not having to fake their trembling now. Same result.

"Sana," Rimsha said slowly, and this fear at least was entirely genuine. "Something's really wrong."

*Aamir, what have you gotten me into?*

Through the window, the campus bustled with ordinary life. But Rimsha Rizvi's world had fractured into before and after, and she had until nightfall to decide what to do with the knowledge burning a hole in her conscience.

The console was hidden. Safe. For now.

The question was: how long could she keep lying to everyone—these men, Sana, maybe even herself—about what she knew?

And what would happen when the truth finally came to light?
