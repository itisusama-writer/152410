# CHAPTER 12: ABNORMALLY LIVED Again

The rest of the morning passed without major incident. Areeba was more careful, keeping her answers in class just good enough to avoid attention but not so brilliant as to raise eyebrows. Faisal, it seemed, had gotten the message about being subtle.

At lunch, they headed to the cafeteria with Sana and a few other girls from their class. The cafeteria was its usual chaos—long lines, crowded tables, the smell of biryani and samosas mixing with too many bodies in too small a space.

They managed to snag a table near the windows. Ayesha was picking at her chicken roll when she noticed Areeba had gone still, her eyes tracking something across the cafeteria.

"What?" Ayesha asked.

"Nothing," Areeba said, but her voice had that faraway quality that meant she was talking to Faisal.

Ayesha followed her gaze and saw a group of girls from the Architecture department sitting a few tables over. They were animated, laughing, one of them gesturing dramatically while telling a story.

"He's watching them," Ayesha said quietly. "Isn't he?"

Areeba's lips quirked in a small smile. "He says the one in the blue dupatta has excellent posture. Very elegant. And the one with the braid has beautiful hands—artistic hands, he says. Perfect for drafting."

Ayesha blinked. "Is he... is he checking out other girls? While in *your* body?"

Areeba's smile widened, but there was a tightness around her eyes. "He's an architect. He appreciates aesthetics. It's professional observation."

"Professional observation," Ayesha repeated flatly.

"That's what he says." But Areeba's jaw was clenched now, her fingers gripping her water bottle a little too hard.

"You're jealous," Ayesha realized. "Oh my God, you're actually jealous."

"I'm not—" Areeba stopped herself. "Maybe a little. It's weird, okay? He gets possessive when guys look at me, but then he can just casually comment on other girls?"

"Did you tell him that?"

Areeba's expression flickered—internal conversation happening at lightning speed. Then her face smoothed into something that wasn't quite her expression. When she spoke, the voice was Faisal's.

"I was merely appreciating the aesthetic—" But the words cut off abruptly as Areeba clearly wrestled back control.

"Don't you dare try to justify it," Areeba hissed under her breath. "You practically snapped Rizwan's head off for being friendly, and now you're—what? Rating girls in the cafeteria?"

Sana looked up from her food. "Who are you talking to?"

"Myself," Areeba said quickly, too quickly. "Just... thinking out loud. About the assignment."

"The assignment makes you angry?" Sana looked confused.

"It's frustrating," Areeba improvised, but her attention was still split, still arguing with someone no one else could see.

Under the table, Ayesha kicked her sister's ankle. Hard.

Areeba yelped, refocusing on the external world. "Ow! What—"

"You're doing it again," Ayesha said pointedly. "The thing we talked about. About being careful?"

Realization dawned on Areeba's face. She glanced around the table—Sana and two other girls were all watching her with varying degrees of concern and curiosity.

"Sorry," Areeba said, forcing a laugh. "I'm just really tired. Didn't sleep well. Makes me spacey."

"You should go to bed earlier," Sana advised. "My sister gets like this when she's sleep-deprived. Starts talking to herself and everything."

"Yeah. I'll do that."

But under her breath, so quiet only Ayesha could hear: "We're not done discussing this."

The whispered response only Areeba could hear must have been something provocative, because her cheeks flushed pink and her eyes widened slightly.

"Faisal!" she hissed.

Ayesha closed her eyes. "I don't even want to know."

"He's being—" Areeba cut herself off, clearly having an entire argument in the space of seconds. Her expressions shifted rapidly—annoyed, embarrassed, reluctantly amused, then annoyed again.

"You two are going to screw this up," Ayesha muttered. "You lovebirds are going to get so caught up in your jealous little spats that someone's going to notice you're literally arguing with yourself in public."

"We're not—lovebirds?" Areeba's voice went up at the end, half-denial, half-question.

"Please. You're fighting like a couple who've been married for twenty years. 'Oh, you can look at other girls but I can't talk to other guys?' This is relationship drama, Areeba. Relationship drama with a ghost who happens to live in your head."

"He's right here, you know," Areeba said defensively. "He can hear you."

"Good." Ayesha raised her voice slightly, still keeping it low enough that their tablemates wouldn't hear. "Faisal, listen carefully. If you want this arrangement to work, you both need to stop acting like possessive teenagers. No jealousy. No taking over to scare off guys. No commenting on other girls while your *host* is sitting right there. Got it?"

Areeba was quiet for a moment, then her expression shifted and Faisal's voice emerged: "You're right. I apologize. To both of you. This is... new. For both of us. Learning to be together like this. I sometimes forget that what I feel affects her, and what she feels affects me. It's—"

"Complicated," Ayesha finished. "Yeah. I got that. But complicated or not, you need to figure it out fast. Before someone notices that Areeba is having full conversations with thin air and starts asking questions neither of you can answer."

Areeba's expression shifted back. "He says he understands. We'll be more careful."

"You better be." Ayesha took a bite of her roll, chewing with more force than necessary. "Because I meant what I said. You two lovebirds are one slip away from disaster."

"Stop calling us that," Areeba muttered, but her cheeks were still pink.

"Are you blushing?" Sana asked, leaning forward with interest. "Who are you texting? Is there a guy?"

"What? No!" Areeba's voice went high with panic. "There's no guy!"

"Then why are you all red and flustered?"

"I'm not—it's just hot in here—"

"It's literally air-conditioned," Sana pointed out. She grinned, delighted by this new development. "There's totally a guy. Come on, spill. Who is he?"

Ayesha watched Areeba squirm, trying to come up with a plausible denial. This was exactly the kind of attention they couldn't afford. But what could Areeba say? *Actually, I'm blushing because the ghost possessing me just said something flirtatious and I don't know how to feel about it?*

"His name is Faisal," Ayesha heard herself say.

Both Areeba and Sana's heads whipped toward her.

"What?" Areeba's eyes were wide with panic.

Ayesha kept her voice casual, like she was sharing harmless gossip. "That guy from the mountains. Remember? The one you were talking about on the bus?"

Understanding flooded Areeba's face. The creative writing assignment story. The fictional male version of herself.

"Oh. Right. That." Areeba latched onto the lifeline. "But he's not real. I mean, he's fiction. The writing exercise I mentioned."

"But you talk about him like he's real," Ayesha continued, warming to the cover story. "I swear, half the time I don't know if you're writing about this character or if you actually met someone in Naran."

"It's for the assignment!" Areeba insisted, but she was smiling now, playing along. "I'm just really into the character development. Getting into his head. That's all."

"Uh-huh." Sana looked between them, skeptical but amused. "Well, fictional or not, he's making you blush. Must be some character."

"He has his moments," Areeba said softly, and Ayesha knew she wasn't talking about a fictional character anymore.

The conversation moved on—Sana started complaining about her Hydraulics professor, and the other girls joined in with their own grievances. But Ayesha kept watching Areeba, watching the small smile that lingered on her face, the way her eyes would occasionally go distant as she listened to something only she could hear.

Lovebirds.

The word had been meant as a criticism, a warning. But watching Areeba now, Ayesha had to acknowledge it might also be accurate.

Whatever was happening between Areeba and Faisal—possession, partnership, or something else entirely—there was affection there. Real affection. Maybe even love, in whatever strange form love could take between the living and the dead.

Which made it simultaneously more beautiful and more dangerous.

Because love made people stupid. Made them take risks they shouldn't take. Made them overlook red flags and ignore warning signs.

And Areeba was already ignoring plenty of both.

---

The rest of the day passed in a strange tension. Areeba continued to excel in ways that were just noticeable enough to draw attention—answering questions with unusual confidence, offering insights that seemed beyond her normal expertise.

In their Surveying lab, she helped three different groups troubleshoot their theodolite readings, explaining the corrections needed with the patience of someone who'd done this hundreds of times.

"Since when are you so good with instruments?" asked Ahmed, one of their lab partners.

"I've been practicing," Areeba replied smoothly.

But Ayesha noticed the faraway look in her eyes. Noticed the way she moved with unusual precision, like someone else was guiding her hands.

By the time Farrukh picked them up at four o'clock, Ayesha was exhausted from watching. From analyzing every word, every gesture, every interaction for signs that someone might notice the truth.

"How was your day, girls?" Farrukh asked as they climbed into the car.

"Good, Baba" Areeba and Ayesha said. Areeba continued "Dr. Raza said I showed excellent understanding in Structural Analysis."

"Did he really?" Farrukh beamed with pride. "That's wonderful, beta! He's such a tough professor. You must have really impressed him."

"I had help," Areeba said quietly, and Ayesha knew she wasn't talking about tutoring.

At home, Faiza had dinner ready—chicken karahi, fresh roti, and raita. The family ate together, Areeba's parents asking about their day, discussing weekend plans, mentioning that Aunt Sadia had invited them over on Friday.

Normal family conversation. Normal domestic life.

Except Ayesha kept watching Areeba, kept waiting for another slip. Another moment when Faisal's personality would bleed through too obviously.

But Areeba was perfectly herself. Laughing at her father's jokes. Helping her mother clear the table. Complaining about the amount of homework Dr. Raza had assigned.

If Ayesha didn't know better, she'd think everything was completely normal.

After dinner, Ayesha followed Areeba to her room—a space she'd been in countless times over the years. Posters of architectural landmarks on the walls. A desk buried under textbooks and sketches. A bulletin board covered with photos of family and friends.

Areeba closed the door and leaned against it, finally letting her careful mask drop. She looked tired.

"That was exhausting," she admitted.

"Which part? Hiding a possession or dealing with a jealous spirit?"

"Both. All of it." Areeba moved to her bed and sat down heavily. "Faisal says he's sorry about earlier. With Rizwan. He knows he overreacted."

"He needs to do more than be sorry," Ayesha said, settling into Areeba's desk chair. "He needs to not do it again. Ever."

"We've been talking about it. Setting rules." Areeba's eyes focused on empty air beside her—where Faisal presumably stood or sat or however ghosts positioned themselves. "He gets that he can't just take over whenever he feels threatened. And I get that I need to be clearer about when he can have control and when he can't."

"This is so weird," Ayesha muttered.

"Tell me about it." Areeba gave a weak laugh. "Try being the one having the conversation."

"So what are these rules?"

Areeba was quiet for a moment, clearly listening to something Ayesha couldn't hear. Then: "He only takes control when I explicitly give permission or when there's an emergency. He doesn't interfere with my social interactions unless I ask for help. And if I tell him to back off, he backs off immediately. No arguments."

"Can he actually stick to that?"

"He says he will. And I believe him."

"Areeba, he's already proven he can't control his jealousy—"

"He's also proven he can help me," Areeba interrupted. "Did you see how well I did today? I understood things I've struggled with all semester. I was confident. I was *good*. That's because of him. Because of what he knows."

"What exactly does he know?" Ayesha asked. "You said something about buildings as living systems. That's not engineering talk. That's architecture."

Areeba smiled, and there was pride in it. "He was an architect. When he was alive. He designed buildings. Beautiful ones, he says. And he remembers all of it—the principles, the process, the way structures work. That's why he can help me with my classes. It's like having a personal tutor who lives in my head."

"When was he alive?"

Areeba's expression flickered—uncertain, almost evasive. "He doesn't remember exactly. A long time ago. Decades, maybe more. The memories are fuzzy."

"How convenient."

"Ayesha—"

"No, seriously. He remembers architecture but not when he died? He remembers structural principles but not his own history? That doesn't strike you as suspicious?"

"Memory fades after death," Areeba said defensively. "Especially when you spend years—maybe centuries—alone in the dark. He's told me what he can remember. The rest is just... gone."

"Or he's lying."

Areeba's expression hardened. "He's not."

"How do you know?"

"Because I know him!" Areeba stood up, pacing now. "I know him the way you know someone you've spent every waking moment with. I hear his thoughts, feel his emotions, share his memories when he shows them to me. He's not lying. He's not manipulating me. He's just a person who died and got stuck and now has a chance to live again. And yes, he's possessive sometimes and yes, he struggles with boundaries, but so do living people. That doesn't make him evil."

"It makes him dangerous."

"Everything is dangerous!" Areeba's voice rose. "Crossing the street is dangerous! Flying on a plane is dangerous! But we do those things because the benefits outweigh the risks. And for me, being with Faisal—learning from him, having him with me—the benefits outweigh the risks."

"You can't possibly know that—"

"I know that before him, I was barely scraping by in my classes," Areeba said. "I know I was anxious all the time, second-guessing myself, feeling like I didn't belong in engineering. And now I feel capable. Confident. Like I actually understand what I'm doing. That's worth something. That's worth a lot."

Ayesha stood too, facing her sister across the small bedroom. "And when other people start noticing? When you go from average student to sudden genius and people ask questions? When Faisal's jealousy causes a scene you can't explain away? When mama, baba realize their daughter is speaking in two different voices? What then?"

"We'll be careful—"

"You were already not careful! Today, in front of everyone!"

"And I handled it!" Areeba shot back. "It was one slip. One moment. And I managed it. I'm learning, Ayesha. We both are. But I need you to have faith in me. Faith that I can make this work."

"I'm trying to protect you!"

"I don't need protection!" Areeba's eyes blazed. "I need support! I need my sister to trust that I know what I'm doing with my own life!"

"You're sharing your life with something we don't understand!"

"Someone! He's someone, not something!"

They stared at each other, both breathing hard, the argument hanging between them like smoke.

Finally, Ayesha broke the silence. "I can't do this. I can't watch this happen and pretend it's okay."

"Then don't watch," Areeba said coldly. "Go home. Leave me alone. I'll handle my own life."

"Areeba—"

"I mean it. If you can't support me, if you're just going to constantly tell me how wrong this is, then I don't want you here. Faisal and I will figure it out on our own."

The words stung. Ayesha felt tears prick her eyes, but she refused to let them fall.

"Fine," she said quietly. "I'll go."

She grabbed her bag and headed for the door. Her hand was on the handle when Areeba's voice stopped her.

"Ayesha, wait."

Ayesha didn't turn around.

"I'm sorry." Areeba's voice was softer now, tired. "I shouldn't have said that. I do need you. I just... I need you to believe in me too."

Ayesha stood there for a long moment, hand on the door, decision balanced on a knife's edge.

Then she turned around.

"I believe that you believe this is right," she said carefully. "I believe you care about him. I believe you think you can control this. But Areeba, I also believe this is going to end badly. And when it does, I'll be here. Not to say I told you so. But to help pick up the pieces."

Areeba's expression softened. "Thank you."

"Don't thank me yet. We're not through this. We're barely at the beginning."

"I know."

Ayesha moved back into the room, settling into the desk chair again. The anger had drained out of both of them, leaving only exhaustion.

"Tell me about him," Ayesha said finally. "Not the architect stuff. Him. Who is he? What's he like?"

Areeba looked surprised by the question. Then a small smile crossed her face. "He's... thoughtful. Curious about everything. He asks a million questions about modern life because so much has changed since he was alive. He thinks cars are miraculous. He's fascinated by the internet. He spent twenty minutes yesterday just watching me scroll through Instagram, amazed that we can see pictures from anywhere in the world instantly."

"What else?"

"He's funny. Sarcastic. He makes commentary on everything—especially people-watching at university. He had very strong opinions about Rizwan's hairstyle." She paused. "He's also lonely. So lonely. When he talks about being trapped in the dark, before he found me, you can hear the desperation. The relief at finally having someone to talk to, something to experience. It's heartbreaking."

"So you're saving him."

"We're saving each other," Areeba corrected. "He gives me confidence and knowledge. I give him life and experience. It's symbiotic."

"Or parasitic."

"Ayesha."

"Sorry. Old habit." Ayesha ran a hand through her hair. "This is going to take me a while to accept. You know that, right?"

"I know. But you're trying. That's enough."

They sat in silence for a while. Outside, the sounds of Lahore evening filtered through the window—car horns, distant calls to prayer, the neighbor's TV playing too loud.

Normal life, continuing around them.

While inside this room, nothing was normal at all.

"Can I ask him something?" Ayesha said suddenly.

Areeba blinked. "Faisal? You want to talk to him?"

"If that's okay."

Areeba was quiet for a moment—internal conversation. Then she nodded. "He says yes."

"Okay." Ayesha felt ridiculous, talking to empty air. But she directed her words to the space beside Areeba where Faisal presumably was. "If you hurt her—if you take too much, or push too hard, or make her lose herself—I will find a way to get rid of you. I don't know how yet. But I will figure it out. Understand?"

Silence. Then Areeba's expression shifted slightly, and when she spoke, the voice was subtly different—deeper, more masculine, but still coming from Areeba's throat.

"I understand. And I give you my word—I will protect her. Always. She is the most precious thing in any world, living or dead. I would never harm her."

Despite everything, despite all her reservations, Ayesha believed him.

Which was either the best or worst thing that could have happened.

"Okay," Ayesha said. "Then we have an understanding."

Areeba's expression shifted back to normal. "He says thank you. For giving us a chance."

"Don't make me regret it."

"We won't."

Ayesha gathered her things for real this time, preparing to head home. At the door, she paused.

"Tomorrow, try to tone down the genius act. You were too noticeable today."

"I will. Faisal agrees—we need to be more subtle."

"Good. And Areeba? Whatever happens, I'm on your side. Even when I think you're wrong. Okay?"

"Okay." Areeba smiled, genuine and warm. "Love you, sister."

"Love you too. Even though you're completely insane."

"We're," Areeba corrected with a small laugh. "We're completely insane."

Ayesha left, heading towards her room.
