The hour-and-a-half mark came and went.

Faiza glanced at the clock on the kitchen wall. She should go upstairs. Should return Faisal to Areeba as promised.

But she was in the middle of understanding structural load distribution, and it was all clicking into place so beautifully, and just a few more minutes wouldn't hurt...

*You're making excuses,* Faisal said quietly.

*I know.*

*She's waiting for me.*

*I know that too.*

But Faiza's feet stayed planted at the kitchen table. Her hands remained on the open textbook. Her mind stayed focused on the diagrams Faisal was helping her understand.

*Just a little longer,* she thought again.

Twenty more minutes passed before guilt finally overpowered desire.

Faiza closed the textbooks with a sigh. "Okay. I should take you back to her."

*Thank you,* Faisal said, and she could hear the relief in his mental voice.

She climbed the stairs slowly, reluctant. Each step taking her closer to the moment she'd have to let go. Return to being empty. Alone in her own head.

She paused outside Areeba's door, her hand on the knob, and opened it quietly.

The room was dark, curtains drawn against the afternoon sun. On the bed, Areeba lay curled on her side, her breathing slow and even.

Asleep.

Faiza crept closer, guilt twisting in her stomach. Areeba's face was peaceful in sleep, but there were tear tracks on her cheeks. Evidence of how hard the separation had been.

*I should have brought you back sooner,* Faiza thought.

*Yes,* Faisal agreed simply.

Faiza stood beside the bed, looking down at her daughter. She should wake her. Should apologize for taking longer than promised. Should make the transfer and leave.

"I know you're there, Mama."

Faiza jumped. Areeba's eyes were open now, though she looked groggy and disoriented.

"I—I was just coming to return Faisal. Like I promised."

"Took you long enough." Areeba's voice was hoarse, exhausted. She sat up slowly, rubbing her eyes. "What time is it?"

"Almost three. I'm sorry, beta. We got caught up in—"

"Yeah, I figured." Areeba looked at her mother for a long moment, then something shifted in her expression. "Are you done studying?"

"Not quite. We were in the middle of a section on—"

"Then go finish it."

Faiza blinked. "What?"

"Go finish your studying session." Areeba lay back down, turning to face the wall. "I'm just going to sleep anyway. What's the point of having him here if I'm unconscious?"

*Areeba—* Faisal started.

"Don't 'Areeba' me," she muttered. "It's a waste. You sitting here watching me sleep while Mama's downstairs actually using you to learn something. It's inefficient."

Faiza stared at her daughter's back, surprised. "You're... giving me permission to keep him longer?"

"I'm too tired to argue about it. And you'll just guilt yourself into coming back in an hour if I make you give him back now. Then you won't finish learning whatever you were learning, and you'll resent me for it, and this whole thing will get even messier." Areeba pulled the blanket up to her shoulders. "So just keep him until you're done. Then come back to my room and get close to me. He'll transfer automatically when I'm nearby."

"That's how it works?"

"Usually. If I'm asleep and not actively holding onto him, he'll default to whoever's conscious and closest. Basic proximity transfer." Areeba yawned. "So go. Study. I'll be here when you're done."

Faiza hesitated. This felt wrong somehow. Too easy.

*She's exhausted,* Faisal said quietly. *The withdrawal wore her out. She doesn't have the energy to be possessive right now.*

*Is that healthy?*

*I don't know. But she's right that it's inefficient for me to sit here while she sleeps. At least with you, I can be useful.*

"Are you sure, beta?" Faiza asked aloud.

"Just go, Mama. Before I change my mind."

*Go,* Faisal confirmed. *I'll come back to her when she needs me.*

Faiza nodded slowly and backed toward the door. "Thank you, Areeba."

Her daughter didn't respond. Just burrowed deeper into the blankets.

Faiza left the room quietly and headed back downstairs, guilt and relief and hunger all tangled together in her chest.

She had him back. Could keep studying. Could maintain that brilliant clarity for a few more hours.

Areeba had given permission. Had practically pushed Faisal toward her.

So why did it still feel like stealing?

---

In the dark room, Areeba lay very still, listening to her mother's footsteps fade down the stairs.

The emptiness was there, gnawing at her. But she was so tired. So worn out from crying and panicking and fighting the withdrawal.

And she'd meant what she said. What was the point of keeping Faisal here while she slept? She couldn't feel his presence when she was unconscious anyway. Couldn't benefit from his companionship or teaching or comfort.

At least with Mama, he could be productive. Could help someone learn. Could fulfill his purpose.

*When did you become so practical about this?* a small voice in her mind asked.

*When I got too exhausted to be irrational,* she thought back.

It was true. The last two hours had drained something out of her. The desperate clinging, the possessiveness, the panic—it had all burned through her reserves until there was nothing left but tired resignation.

Maybe this was what Ayesha had felt. This flat, exhausted acceptance.

Maybe this was how you survived the withdrawal. You just... gave up fighting it. Let it wash over you until you were too numb to care anymore.

Areeba closed her eyes and tried to sleep.

It took a long time.

Downstairs, Faiza settled back at the kitchen table, the textbooks spread before her once more.

*Where were we?* she asked Faisal.

*Load distribution in cantilever structures. But Faiza, we should talk about—*

*About how unhealthy this is? About how I'm taking advantage of my daughter's exhaustion? I know, Faisal. I know all of it. But she gave permission. And I'm not strong enough to refuse.*

*That's what worries me.*

*It worries me too. But not enough to stop.*

She turned the page in her textbook, and Faisal sighed—a strange sensation, feeling someone else's emotion in your own mind—and continued teaching.

They worked for another two hours. Faiza absorbed concepts she'd struggled with for years, understanding clicking into place with Faisal's patient explanations. It was intoxicating. Better than she remembered from the first session.

*You're building tolerance,* Faisal observed. *Needing more time to feel satisfied.*

*Stop psychoanalyzing and explain this formula.*

*Faiza—*

*Please. Just let me have this.*

He did. Because he was kind. Because he couldn't help but teach when someone wanted to learn.

And because, perhaps, he was lonely too. Tired of being fought over. Grateful to have someone who just wanted knowledge rather than possession.

The afternoon faded into evening. The light through the kitchen window went golden, then dim.

Faiza finally closed the last textbook with a satisfied sigh. "That was incredible. I understand now. I actually understand."

*You always had the capability. You just needed someone to explain it properly.*

*You're a good teacher.*

*Thank you.*

Faiza sat there for a moment, reluctant to move. Because moving meant going upstairs. Meant getting close to Areeba and triggering the automatic transfer.

Meant giving him up.

"I don't want to let you go," she admitted quietly.

*I know.*

"How do you do this? Go back and forth between people, knowing each transfer means someone suffers?"

*I don't know. I hate it. Every time I leave someone, I feel their pain. Their emptiness. It's agonizing.*

*Then why do you keep doing it?*

*Because the alternative is worse. Staying with one person exclusively while the others suffer from a distance. At least this way, I can try to help everyone.*

"That's not sustainable."

*I know.*

"Something has to change."

*I know that too.*

Faiza stood up slowly, joints stiff from sitting so long. She gathered the textbooks, putting them back on the shelf. Procrastinating.

Finally, there was nothing left to do but go upstairs.

She climbed the steps like they were a gallows. Each one taking her closer to the loss she dreaded.

Areeba's door was still ajar. Faiza pushed it open quietly.

The room was darker now, evening shadows filling the corners. On the bed, Areeba was curled into a tight ball, blanket pulled over her head.

Faiza stepped closer.

The transfer happened the moment she crossed the threshold—sudden and automatic, just like Areeba had said. Faisal pulled away from Faiza's mind and rushed toward the sleeping girl like water flowing downhill.

And Faiza was empty.

The loss hit like a physical blow. She actually gasped, had to grab the doorframe to stay upright.

*Oh god.*

This was worse than last time. Sharper. More painful.

Because she'd had him longer. Because the attachment had deepened.

Because she was already craving the next time she could have him back.

Faiza stood there, hollow and aching, and watched her daughter's breathing even out. Watched the tension leave Areeba's shoulders as Faisal settled back into her mind, even in sleep.

*This is what Areeba feels,* Faiza realized. *Every time. This emptiness. This loss.*

And suddenly she understood her daughter's desperate clinging in a way she hadn't before.

If Faiza felt this bad after just two sessions, how must Areeba feel after months? How much worse must the withdrawal be for her?

*We're all addicted,* Faiza thought numbly. *All of us. Even Ayesha, who's trying so hard to pretend she's moved on.*

This wasn't sustainable. It wasn't safe.

But Faiza didn't know how to stop it.

Didn't know if she even wanted to.

She backed out of the room quietly and closed the door.

Down the hall, she could see light under Ayesha's door. Her younger daughter, home from work, shut away in her room. Hiding from this impossible situation.

Faiza should check on her. Should make sure she was okay.

But she couldn't face it right now. Couldn't face anyone while feeling this hollow.

She went to her own bedroom instead, where her husband was reading.

"How did it go?" he asked, looking up.

"I'm addicted," Faiza said flatly. "After two sessions, I'm already planning when I can have him again. Already resenting Areeba for having him all the time." She sat on the bed heavily. "We need help. Professional help. Tomorrow."

Her husband set down his book and pulled her close. "Okay. Tomorrow. First thing."

Faiza nodded against his shoulder, but even as she agreed, part of her mind was already planning.

Planning how to convince whoever they consulted that this could continue.

Planning how to get more time with Faisal.

Planning around the addiction she'd just admitted to having.

She was lost. They were all lost.

And Faiza had no idea how to find their way back.
