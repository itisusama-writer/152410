# CHAPTER 8: BOUNDARIES

The descent from Babusar Top took nearly four hours. By the time the jeeps rolled back into Naran Bazaar, the sun was setting behind the mountains, painting everything in shades of amber and rose gold. Everyone was exhausted—the kind of bone-deep weariness that came from thin air, constant adrenaline, and bodies pushed beyond comfortable limits.

Everyone except Areeba.

She climbed out of the jeep with energy that should have been impossible after such a grueling day. While the others moved like elderly people, groaning and holding their backs, Areeba stretched casually and grabbed bags to help carry inside.

"Beta, you don't have to—" Aunt Sadia started.

"It's fine, Auntie!" Areeba hoisted two bags easily, one on each shoulder. "I've got it."

Uncle Jamil watched her with an expression mixing pride and confusion. "I don't know where you get your energy. When I was your age, maybe. But now?" He rubbed his lower back ruefully.

Faisal—because it was definitely Faisal carrying those bags—just smiled. "Good genes, Uncle."

They trudged into Lalazar Hotel's lobby, which now felt warm and welcoming after the brutal cold of the mountain pass. The smell of cooking meat and fresh naan wafted from the restaurant, making stomachs growl despite exhaustion.

"Dinner in thirty minutes," Uncle Jamil announced. "Just enough time to freshen up and pray Maghrib."

The family separated to their rooms. Ayesha climbed the stairs slowly, each step requiring conscious effort. Her legs felt like lead. Her head still ached from the altitude. All she wanted was to collapse on her bed and not move for several hours.

Behind her, Areeba climbed the stairs carrying two heavy bags without breaking a sweat.

Inside Room 9, Aunt Fareeda and Aunt Sadia immediately claimed the beds, lying down with grateful sighs.

"I'm too old for this," Aunt Sadia moaned. "Tomorrow we're doing something flat. A nice, flat market. No mountains."

"Agreed," Aunt Fareeda said, her eyes already closing. "Just give me ten minutes before dinner..."

Within moments, both aunts were dozing, their breathing deep and even.

Which left Ayesha and Areeba alone. Awake. With thirty minutes until dinner.

Ayesha sat on her bed, pulling off her shoes with a wince. Her feet were swollen from the altitude and the hours cramped in the jeep. She glanced across the room at Areeba, who had set down the bags and was now moving around the room, putting things away, organizing, restless.

"You should rest," Ayesha said quietly, careful not to wake the aunts.

"Not tired," Areeba said. Then she paused, tilted her head slightly, listening to something Ayesha couldn't hear. "Well, I am. But not enough to sleep."

Ayesha studied her cousin. The transitions had become so smooth now—so seamless—that she could barely tell when the switch happened unless she was really watching. But she could still see the tells. The way Areeba's posture would shift. The way her expressions would change, subtle but distinct.

Right now, watching Areeba move around the room with that efficient, purposeful energy, Ayesha was pretty sure she was watching Faisal.

"Can I ask you something?" Ayesha said.

Areeba stopped, turned to face her. "Sure."

"How does it work? The switching. Does it hurt?"

A pause. Then Areeba came and sat on Ayesha's bed, cross-legged, her posture open. When she spoke, her voice was Areeba's, but thoughtful in a way that suggested both of them were answering.

"No. It doesn't hurt. Not anymore. At first it was... jarring. Disorienting. Like being pushed under water and then suddenly breaking the surface, over and over. But now..." She searched for words. "Now it's more like... stepping back and letting someone else drive. I'm still there. Still aware. Just not in control."

"So you can see everything? Even when he's in control?"

"Yes. I'm always aware. Always present." Areeba's expression shifted slightly—Faisal taking over the conversation. "And I'm always aware of her. It's like... sharing headphones. We both hear the music, but only one of us is choosing the song at any given time."

The metaphor was oddly poetic. Ayesha didn't know how to respond.

"What about feelings?" she asked instead. "Do you feel what he feels? Does he feel what you feel?"

"Yes," they said in unison. Then Areeba laughed—a strange, layered sound that was somehow both of them. "Sorry. We both wanted to answer that one. Yes, we feel everything. When I'm happy, he feels it. When he's angry, I feel it. It's..."

"Intimate," Faisal finished, his tone making it clear this was both statement and complaint.

"It must be overwhelming," Ayesha said.

"It was. Less so now. We've learned to... give each other space. Mentally, if not physically." Areeba's expression flickered again—a rapid back-and-forth like they were debating who should speak. Finally, Areeba settled. "He's getting better at staying quiet when I need him to. And I'm getting better at letting him have the front when he needs it."

"Like today. At Babusar Top."

"Yes." Areeba's voice was soft, grateful. "I was so cold. So tired. And scared when those men showed up. I couldn't have handled any of it. But he could. He did."

"You thanked him," Ayesha said. "I heard you."

Areeba nodded. "He saved Aunt Fareeda. Of course I thanked him."

It was surreal. Listening to her cousin talk about her possessor like a roommate. A partner. Someone deserving of gratitude and consideration.

"Aren't you angry?" Ayesha asked. "At what he did to you? Taking over your body without permission?"

Areeba was quiet for a long moment. Outside, the call to Maghrib prayer echoed from the mosque down the street. Inside, Aunt Fareeda stirred in her sleep but didn't wake.

"I was," Areeba finally said. "At first. I was terrified. Furious. I fought so hard to push him out." She looked at her hands. "But he was stronger. And I was disappearing. Bit by bit, piece by piece, I could feel myself getting smaller. Getting lost."

"So you made a deal to survive."

"Yes. But it's more than that now." Areeba met Ayesha's eyes. "He's not what I thought. He's not evil. He's not trying to hurt me or use me for something terrible. He's just... lost. He was trapped for so long in nothing, nowhere, and when I came through—whatever threshold I crossed—he saw a chance to live again. To feel. To experience the world."

"Through you."

"Through me," Areeba agreed. "And yes, that's not fair. I know that. But life isn't fair. And between being completely consumed and sharing... I chose sharing."

Ayesha wanted to argue. Wanted to tell her cousin this was wrong, unnatural, that there had to be another way. But what way? She had no idea how to exorcise a spirit. No idea if it was even possible without hurting Areeba in the process.

"Does the family suspect?" Ayesha asked instead. "About... him?"

"No. Just you." Areeba smiled slightly. "You always were more observant than the others. But they just think I'm recovering from the fainting spells. That I'm acting a bit strange because of stress or altitude or head trauma."

"What you did today—that wrist lock—someone's going to start asking questions."

"Maybe." Areeba shrugged. "We'll say I took self-defense classes. Muscle memory kicked in. They'll believe it because they want to believe it. Because the alternative is too strange."

She was right. People believed what made sense to them. What fit their worldview. A possessed cousin sharing her body with a male spirit? That was too far outside normal for most people to accept.

"I won't tell them," Ayesha said quietly. "I still think this is wrong. Unnatural. But... I won't tell them. Not unless you want me to."

Relief flooded Areeba's face—pure Areeba, grateful and loving. "Thank you. Really. Thank you."

She reached out and squeezed Ayesha's hand. Her grip was warm, solid, real. This was still her cousin. Still the girl she'd grown up with, shared secrets with, loved like a sister.

Just... not only her anymore.

A knock on the door made them both jump.

"Ladies?" Uncle Jamil's voice called. "Dinner in five minutes!"

"Coming!" Ayesha called back.

The aunts woke with groans and protests, struggling to vertical positions. The room filled with the familiar chaos of getting ready—fixing hair, adjusting dupattas, finding shoes.

Ayesha watched Areeba move through it all, chatting with the aunts, laughing at Aunt Sadia's complaints, perfectly normal and perfectly herself.

No one else could see what Ayesha saw. The slight tilt of the head when Faisal was listening. The way Areeba's expression would go momentarily blank when they were having an internal conversation.

They went down to dinner as a family. The restaurant was warm and loud, filled with other tourists sharing stories of their mountain adventures. The family claimed a large table, and food arrived in generous portions—karahi, daal, fresh naan, rice.

Everyone ate with the intensity of people who'd burned thousands of calories in thin mountain air. Conversation flowed, stories were retold and embellished, laughter echoed.

Ayesha picked at her food, her appetite dulled by exhaustion and the day's revelations. Across the table, Areeba ate with enthusiasm, responding to questions about how she'd learned that "impressive defensive move."

"Just some self-defense classes," Areeba said modestly. "My instructor said I was a natural."

"You should teach us!" Aunt Fareeda said. "Especially in times like these, when men think they can do whatever they want."

"Maybe," Areeba said, and Ayesha caught the flicker of Faisal's satisfaction in her eyes. He liked being useful. Being needed.

After dinner, the family lingered over chai, too full and comfortable to move. The children had fallen asleep in their chairs. The adults talked in the lazy, meandering way of people with nowhere to be.

Finally, Uncle Jamil yawned and checked his watch. "It's late. Tomorrow we rest. No mountains. Just the bazaar, maybe some shopping. Everyone sleep in."

The proclamation was met with grateful murmurs. They made their way upstairs slowly, bodies heavy with food and fatigue.

Back in Room 9, the aunts went through their nighttime routines quickly, eager for bed. Ayesha changed into her sleep clothes and collapsed onto her bed with a sigh of relief.

Across the room, Areeba sat on her bed, braiding her hair for the night. Her movements were practiced, automatic. Definitely Areeba—Faisal wouldn't know how to do this.

The aunts' breathing deepened into sleep within minutes. The room fell quiet except for the distant sounds of the bazaar outside—voices, music, the occasional car horn.

Ayesha was drifting toward sleep when she heard it—Areeba's voice, whisper-soft, talking to herself.

"You should sleep too."

A pause.

"Not tired." Faisal's tone, but quiet.

"You've been active all day. You carried those bags. You need rest."

"I don't sleep the same way you do."

"What does that mean?"

Ayesha kept her eyes closed, pretending to sleep, listening to the impossible conversation.

"I don't need to sleep when you sleep," Faisal explained, his voice patient. "When you're resting, I can... observe. Think. Process. I'm still conscious even when you're not."

"That sounds lonely."

A long pause. Then, quieter: "It is. Sometimes."

"I'm sorry."

"Don't be. This is better than before. Than the nothing."

Another pause. Ayesha heard the rustle of blankets as Areeba settled into bed.

"Can I ask you something?" Areeba's voice was small, vulnerable.

"Of course."

"Are you going to stay forever? Or is this temporary? Will you leave when... when the trip is over?"

The silence stretched so long Ayesha thought Faisal might not answer. Then:

"I don't know. I don't know if I can leave. Or if I want to. I'm sorry. I know that's not what you want to hear."

"I don't know what I want to hear," Areeba admitted. "Part of me wants you gone. Wants my body back, completely mine. But part of me..." She trailed off.

"Part of you what?"

"Part of me would miss you. Is that crazy? You invaded me. Took over my body. I should hate you. But when you protected Aunt Fareeda today, when you helped me through the cold at Babusar Top... I was grateful. Not just for the help, but for the company. For not being alone in my own head."

Ayesha's chest tightened at the confession. Areeba was forming a bond with her possessor. Not just accepting him out of necessity, but actually developing... what? Friendship? Partnership?

"I would miss you too," Faisal said quietly. "You're... kind. Brave. You could have fought me harder. Made this unbearable for both of us. But you chose cooperation. I've never experienced that before."

"Before? You mean you've done this before? Possessed other people?"

"No. Never. I tried, over the years. But I was too weak. Too formless. You're the first who was... compatible. The first I could actually connect with."

"Lucky me," Areeba said, but there was no bitterness in it. Almost affection.

"Lucky us," Faisal corrected.

Ayesha heard Areeba shifting in bed, getting comfortable. Then her voice again, firmer now:

"Hey."

"What?"

"I'm about to have girl talk with Ayesha tomorrow. About private stuff. You stay quiet for that, understand? Don't get into girls talk."

A pause. Then Faisal's amused response: "Girl talk. You mean about—"

"Private. Stuff. Not for you."

"I'm literally inside your head. How exactly am I supposed to not hear?"

"You can hear, but you don't comment. You don't contribute. You just... think about something else. Go to your mental corner."

"I don't have a mental corner."

"Then find one. Make one. I don't care. But some things are just for girls, and you need to respect that boundary."

Ayesha almost smiled despite everything. Areeba was setting boundaries with her possessor like he was a nosy roommate.

"Fine," Faisal said, and he actually sounded chastened. "I'll... think about mountains or something when you have girl talk."

"Thank you." A pause. "Now let me sleep. I'm exhausted."

"I told you to sleep hours ago."

"And I told you I'll sleep when I want to. You can sleep without me sleeping, remember? You just said that. So if you're tired, sleep. Don't wait for me."

"I wanted to make sure you were comfortable. Safe."

The protective tone in Faisal's voice made something in Ayesha's chest twist. He cared about Areeba. Genuinely cared.

"I'm safe," Areeba said softly. "We're in a hotel with family all around us. Nothing's going to happen. You can rest. Or observe. Or whatever it is you do. But stop hovering."

"I don't hover."

"You literally hover inside my consciousness. That's the definition of hovering."

A sound that might have been Faisal's laugh—or Areeba imagining his laugh. The line was blurring.

"Good night, Faisal."

"Good night, Areeba."

Silence fell. Ayesha lay in the darkness, processing what she'd heard. They weren't just coexisting anymore. They were developing routines. Setting boundaries. Having actual conversations that sounded almost... domestic.

The possession was becoming a partnership. The invasion was becoming a relationship.

And Ayesha had no idea if that made things better or infinitely worse.

She fell asleep to the sound of Areeba's gentle breathing and the whisper of the mountain wind outside, carrying secrets the world wasn't ready to know.
