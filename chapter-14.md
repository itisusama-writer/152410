# CHAPTER 14: ADDICTION

The silence in Areeba's room was suffocating.

She sat cross-legged on her bed, arms wrapped tightly around herself, staring at nothing. Her eyes were red and puffy from crying, her face blotchy. But the tears had finally stopped.

*Areeba, please.*

Faisal's voice in her mind was gentle, pleading. It had been like this for the past hour—him trying to explain, her refusing to listen.

"I said I don't want to talk about it," she muttered aloud.

*You can't just shut me out forever. We share the same space. The same existence.*

"Watch me."

She felt him withdraw slightly, hurt. Good. Let him feel a fraction of what she'd felt waking up to that terrible emptiness.

But even as she thought it, guilt twisted in her stomach. Because she could sense his emotions now, bleeding through their connection. Regret. Worry. And underneath it all, genuine confusion about what he'd done wrong.

*I was trying to help,* Faisal said quietly. *She asked to understand. I thought—*

"You thought you'd spend the night with my sister instead of me?" The words came out sharper than she intended. "You thought that was a good idea?"

*It wasn't like that.*

"Then what was it like, Faisal? Explain it to me. Because from where I'm sitting, you chose her over me."

*I didn't choose—*

"You left me!" Her voice cracked. "I was asleep and vulnerable and you just... left."

She felt the shift in his consciousness—understanding finally dawning.

*You thought I abandoned you,* he said softly. *When you woke up alone, you thought I'd left for good.*

Areeba didn't answer. Couldn't answer around the lump in her throat.

*Areeba, I would never. I came back to you immediately when—*

"After spending the whole night with her," Areeba interrupted. "After talking to her. After letting her experience what we have. What I thought was *ours.*"

Silence. Then:

*You're jealous.*

"Don't." She squeezed her eyes shut. "Don't psychoanalyze me right now."

*I'm not. I'm just... I didn't realize. I thought you'd understand. She's your sister. She was trying to help.*

"By taking you from me?"

*By trying to understand what you're going through. So she could support you better.*

Areeba wanted to stay angry. Wanted to hold onto this hurt and betrayal. But his words were seeping through her defenses, making horrible, reasonable sense.

"You should have asked me first," she said finally, her voice small.

*You're right. I should have. I'm sorry.*

The sincerity in his mental voice made something in her chest loosen. She took a shaky breath.

"And you should have come back sooner."

*I know. I'm sorry for that too.*

Areeba uncrossed her arms, running her hands through her tangled hair. She was exhausted—emotionally wrung out from the fear and anger and crying.

"I don't want to lose you," she whispered. "When I woke up and you weren't there, I thought—" She couldn't finish the sentence.

*You won't lose me. I promise.*

"You can't promise that. You don't know what's going to happen. You could fade away or move on or—"

*Then I promise I won't leave you by choice. Is that better?*

It wasn't, really. But it was something.

"Just..." She swallowed hard. "Don't go to her again. Please."

*Areeba—*

"I know it's selfish. I know she's my sister and she's trying to help. But I can't—" Her voice broke. "I can't share you. I can't wake up wondering if you'll be there or if you're off having conversations with someone else in the middle of the night. I just can't."

She felt his hesitation. His desire to argue, to point out the unfairness of her request. But also his understanding of her fear.

*Okay,* he said finally. *I won't go to her again.*

Relief flooded through her, so intense it made her dizzy.

"Thank you."

*But you need to talk to her eventually. She didn't mean to hurt you.*

"I know. Just... not yet. I can't yet."

*Fair enough.*

Areeba lay back on her bed, staring at her ceiling. The anger had drained away, leaving her feeling hollow and tired.

"I'm sorry I yelled at you," she said quietly.

*I deserved it.*

"You didn't. Not really. You were trying to be kind."

*Kind in a spectacularly stupid way.*

Despite everything, Areeba felt her lips twitch. "Yeah. Pretty stupid."

*For a genius spirit, I can be remarkably dense about emotions.*

"You really can."

They lapsed into silence, but it was comfortable now. The connection between them settled back into its familiar warmth, the sharp edges of conflict smoothing over.

Areeba closed her eyes, finally relaxing.

"Don't leave me again," she murmured, half-asleep. "Even if I'm being unreasonable. Even if someone else asks. Just... stay."

*Always,* Faisal promised.

And this time, she believed him.

---

Down the hall, Ayesha wasn't finding any peace.

She'd tried studying. Tried watching videos on her phone. Tried doing literally anything to distract herself from the hollow feeling in her mind.

Nothing worked.

It had been less than twelve hours since Faisal left, and Ayesha felt like she was going through withdrawal. Her thoughts kept circling back to those few hours—the warmth of his presence, the comfort of not being alone in her own head, the fascinating intimacy of sharing consciousness with another being.

She wanted it back.

The realization was terrifying. One night. She'd had one night with someone else's spirit companion, and now she was craving it like an addict.

*This is what Areeba feels,* she thought. *This is why she can't give him up.*

Understanding didn't make it easier. If anything, it made it worse, because now Ayesha knew exactly what she was missing.

She pulled out her phone, typed a message to Areeba, then deleted it. Typed another. Deleted that too.

What was she supposed to say? *Hey, I know I betrayed your trust and stole your spirit boyfriend, but any chance I could borrow him again sometime?*

Ridiculous. Impossible. Areeba would never agree.

But the wanting didn't stop.

Ayesha set her phone aside and hugged her pillow, trying to logic herself out of these feelings. She couldn't have Faisal. He wasn't hers. He belonged with Areeba—had chosen Areeba. And even if he hadn't, sharing him would destroy her relationship with her sister.

Some things weren't worth the cost.

Even if they felt like they might be.

---

Sunday passed in tense silence. Areeba stayed in her room most of the day, only emerging for meals. When she did, she was polite but distant—answering Mama's questions about homework, nodding at Baba's comments about the news, carefully avoiding looking at Ayesha.

Ayesha wanted to apologize. Wanted to explain. But every time she tried to catch Areeba alone, her sister found an excuse to leave.

By Monday, Ayesha was desperate enough to try a different approach.

She woke up early, made tea, and knocked on Areeba's door before her sister left for university.

"What?" Areeba's voice was flat.

"I made you tea. Cardamom, the way you like it."

A pause. Then the door opened a crack. Areeba looked exhausted—dark circles under her eyes, her hair pulled back in a messy bun.

"Thanks," she said, taking the cup without meeting Ayesha's eyes.

"Can we talk?"

"We're talking now."

"Areeba, please. I need to explain—"

"There's nothing to explain. You wanted to experience it. You did. It's done."

"I'm sorry," Ayesha said. "I really am. I should have asked you first. I should have—"

"Yes. You should have." Areeba finally looked at her, and the hurt in her eyes made Ayesha's chest ache. "But you didn't."

"I know. And I feel terrible about it. I wasn't thinking about how it would affect you. I was just curious and I—"

"Curious," Areeba repeated, her voice hardening. "Right."

She started to close the door, but Ayesha put her hand out to stop it.

"Wait. Please. I just..." She took a breath, knowing she shouldn't ask but unable to stop herself. "What if... I mean, sometimes... could I maybe—"

Understanding flashed across Areeba's face, followed immediately by disbelief.

"Are you seriously asking what I think you're asking?"

"I just thought—"

"No." Areeba's voice was ice. "Absolutely not."

"But if he agreed—"

"I don't care if he agreed. I'm saying no. He's not a toy we can pass back and forth, Ayesha. He's—" She stopped, struggling for words. "He's mine. *Mine.* And I'm not sharing him. Not with you. Not with anyone."

"I understand you're upset, but—"

"Do you?" Areeba laughed, but there was no humor in it. "Do you really understand? Because you had him for one night and you're already asking for more. Imagine if you'd had him for weeks. Imagine building your entire existence around having someone there, always. And then imagine your sister asking if she can have him sometimes too. How would that feel?"

Ayesha opened her mouth, then closed it. Because Areeba was right. If their positions were reversed, she'd feel exactly the same way.

Possessive. Territorial. Unwilling to share.

"I'm sorry," she whispered.

"I know you are. But that doesn't change anything."

Areeba closed the door, gently but firmly. This time, Ayesha let her.

She stood in the hallway, holding her own cup of tea, feeling the hollow space in her mind more acutely than ever.

This was her punishment, she supposed. To know exactly what she couldn't have. To understand perfectly why Areeba would never share.

And to live with the wanting anyway.

---

The week crept by with painful slowness.

At university, Ayesha went through the motions—attending lectures, taking notes, participating in group projects. But her mind kept drifting, circling back to those few hours of connection.

She caught herself staring at Areeba sometimes, watching for the telltale signs of internal conversation. The small smiles. The pauses. The shifting expressions that meant Faisal was speaking.

It made the hollow feeling worse.

Sana noticed. "You okay? You seem distracted."

"Just tired," Ayesha lied. "Not sleeping well."

"Boy trouble?"

If only. Boy trouble she could handle. She could talk to Sana about boys, get advice, process her feelings like a normal person.

But this? Missing a spirit she'd borrowed from her sister for one night? Craving a presence in her mind that didn't belong to her?

There was no normal way to process that.

"Something like that," she said.

At home, the atmosphere remained strained. Areeba was cordial but distant, creating an invisible wall between them. They shared meals, shared space, but the easy closeness they'd always had was gone.

Mama noticed something was off. "You girls fighting?" she asked one evening.

"No, Mama," Areeba said smoothly. "Just busy with university. Lots of assignments."

"Hmm." Mama didn't look convinced, but she didn't push.

Friday evening, Ayesha was in her room when she heard Areeba laughing in the hallway—really laughing, bright and genuine. Talking to Faisal, clearly. Having a conversation Ayesha couldn't hear, sharing a joke she wasn't part of.

The jealousy hit like a physical blow.

She wanted to be angry at Areeba for being so happy while Ayesha suffered. But she couldn't even have that, because Areeba had every right to be happy with Faisal. He was hers. Her companion, her partner, her... whatever they were to each other.

Ayesha had no claim to him. No right to feel this way.

But knowing that didn't make the wanting stop.

She pulled out her phone and opened her notes app, typing quickly:

*Things I can't have:*
*- Faisal*
*- That feeling of not being alone*
*- My sister's forgiveness (not really)*
*- A normal life where I don't know what I'm missing*

She stared at the list, then deleted it.

Writing it down didn't help. Nothing helped.

Ayesha flopped back on her bed, pressing her palms against her eyes until she saw stars.

One night. She'd had one night.

And now she understood addiction in a way she never had before—the specific torture of knowing exactly what you wanted, having tasted it once, and knowing you could never have it again.

Outside her room, Areeba laughed at something again.

Ayesha rolled over and buried her face in her pillow, trying not to hear it.

Trying not to want.

Failing at both.
