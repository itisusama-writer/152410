# CHAPTER 17: THE TEST

Thursday morning started badly.

Ayesha woke at 6 AM after a restless night, her mind already churning through structural analysis formulas. She showered, dressed, forced down some breakfast despite her nervous stomach. Mama noticed her anxiety and packed her a granola bar "for energy during the exam."

At 8:30, Ayesha gathered her calculator, pencils, and ID, ready to head to campus.

She knocked on Areeba's door. "I'm leaving."

"Okay." Areeba's voice was muffled. "Good luck."

Ayesha waited, but Areeba didn't come out. Didn't open the door for the transfer.

*She must be sleeping in,* Ayesha thought. *She doesn't have an exam until this afternoon.*

The reminder settled uneasily in her stomach. Areeba had Advanced Calculus at 2 PM. Which meant Faisal should come to Ayesha at 2, not now.

But Areeba knew Ayesha's exam was at 10. They'd talked about it. The arrangement was clear.

Ayesha waited another moment, then checked her phone. 8:35. She needed to leave or she'd be late.

"I'm going!" she called through the door.

"'Kay," Areeba mumbled back.

Ayesha left, pushing down the weird feeling that something was off.

---

The examination hall was in the main engineering building, a large room with rows of individual desks spread far apart. Ayesha found her assigned seat near the middle, set out her materials, and tried to calm her racing heart.

Around her, other third-year students were doing the same—the nervous pre-exam ritual of preparation and last-minute prayer.

At 9:55, the proctor stood at the front. "Phones off and in your bags. No smart watches, no talking, no looking at other students' papers. You have three hours for this exam. Any questions?"

No one spoke.

"Papers are face down. Do not turn them over until I say begin."

The proctor walked the aisles, placing exam booklets at each desk. Ayesha stared at the blank blue cover, her palms sweating.

*You studied,* she reminded herself. *You know this material. Just breathe.*

"You may begin."

Ayesha flipped over the exam and started reading.

**Question 1: A simply supported beam carries a uniformly distributed load of 25 kN/m over a span of 8 meters. Calculate the maximum bending moment and shear force.**

Okay. She knew this. Basic beam analysis. She'd done dozens of these practice problems.

Ayesha started drawing her free body diagram, labeling forces, calculating reactions—

*That's not quite right.*

She froze, her pencil halfway through sketching the shear force diagram.

The voice in her head was gentle, familiar, and definitely not her own.

*Faisal?*

*Hello, Ayesha.*

*What are you—why are you here?*

*Areeba didn't took me back last night. I was teching you both one by one and I am not stuck with you.*

Ayesha's heart sank. She glanced around the exam hall, but of course no one was paying attention to her. They were all focused on their own papers, their own problems.

*You need to go to Areeba,* Ayesha thought urgently. *She has an exam this afternoon. She needs you.*

*I know. But I can't go to her right now.*

*What do you mean you can't?*

*She's too far away. I can jump between you two when you're close—same house, same building. But you're at the engineering campus and she's at home. That distance is too far for me to bridge on my own. She needs to come near you, or you need to go near her.*

Ayesha stared down at her exam paper, panic rising in her chest.

*So you're stuck with me.*

*Until you're closer to Areeba, yes.*

*But I'm in the middle of an exam!*

*I know. I'm sorry.*

Ayesha pressed her fingers to her temples, trying to think. The clock on the wall showed 10:08. She'd already lost eight minutes. Around her, other students were writing steadily, making progress.

She looked back at her free body diagram.

*Your calculation for the reaction forces is off,* Faisal said, his mental voice apologetic. *You distributed the load incorrectly. It should be—*

*Stop!*

Several students glanced up at the vehemence of her internal shout. Ayesha quickly looked down at her paper, trying to appear normal.

*Stop it,* she thought more quietly but no less firmly. *I don't want to cheat.*

*I'm just trying to help—*

*I know. But this is my exam. I need to do it myself.*

*But you're making a mistake.*

*Then I'll make a mistake! That's my choice.*

Silence in her mind. Ayesha could feel Faisal's presence, hurt and confused. He was trying to help. From his perspective, why wouldn't he help someone he cared about?

But Ayesha had seen what this did to Areeba. Had seen her sister's guilt and shame. And she'd meant what she said—she wanted to earn her degree honestly.

Even if that meant failing.

She took a breath and went back to her calculations, deliberately ignoring the gentle wrongness Faisal was radiating at her errors.

*Can you not go to Areeba right now?* she asked, trying to focus on the problem. *Like, try harder? It's really important.*

*I can't,* Faisal said, and there was frustration in his mental tone too. *The distance is too great. I'm bound to one of you—I can't just float in between. Unless...*

*Unless what?*

*There are other girls in this exam hall. I could jump to one of them temporarily. Get out of your head so I'm not distracting you.*

Ayesha's pencil stilled.

The thought of Faisal in someone else's mind—some random girl, a stranger—made something hot and possessive flare in her chest.

But worse was the image of Areeba's face if she found out. Areeba, who was struggling with every moment Faisal wasn't with her. Areeba, who'd begged Ayesha not to try to steal him.

*Don't,* Ayesha thought sharply. *Areeba will kill me.*

*She doesn't have to know—*

*She'll know. Somehow she'll find out, and she'll never forgive me. Please, just... just stay quiet. Don't help me in my exam. Can you do that?*

A pause.

*I can try,* Faisal said finally. *But Ayesha, I was a teacher for thirty years. It's instinct for me to correct errors when I see them. Especially in my field.*

*Try harder.*

*Alright. I'll do my best.*

His presence in her mind shifted, becoming more muted. Not gone—he couldn't leave—but pulled back. Giving her space.

Ayesha returned her attention to the exam, painfully aware she'd now lost fifteen minutes.

Question 1. Beam analysis. She could do this.

She started over, working through the problem step by step. Calculating reaction forces, drawing shear and moment diagrams, finding the maximum values.

It was hard to concentrate with Faisal in her head. Even quiet, his presence was distracting—a constant warmth and awareness that pulled at her focus.

And there were moments when she could feel him react to her work. A wordless sense of approval when she got something right. A gentle wince when she made an error.

*You said you'd stay quiet,* she thought.

*I'm not saying anything!*

*But I can feel your reactions.*

*I can't help that. You're thinking very loudly.*

Ayesha bit back a frustrated sigh and kept working.

Question 2: Truss analysis. Question 3: Column buckling. Question 4: Design of a reinforced concrete beam.

She worked methodically, checking her calculations twice, trying to ignore the presence in her mind that kept having opinions about her answers.

Halfway through Question 5, Faisal broke his silence.

*That's definitely wrong.*

*Faisal—*

*I know, I know, you don't want help. But you're using the wrong formula entirely. You're going to get zero marks for this whole section.*

*Then I get zero marks.*

*But you know the right approach! You studied this! You're just mixing up the cases. If you'd just look at—*

*No.*

*Ayesha, this is painful to watch.*

*Then don't watch! Think about something else. Recite poetry. Do whatever you did when you were alive and bored.*

*I was never bored. I was teaching.*

*Well, you're not teaching now. You're being quiet and letting me take my exam in peace.*

She felt his mental huff of frustration, but he went quiet again.

The clock ticked on. 11:15. 11:45. 12:20.

Ayesha's hand was cramping from writing, and her brain felt like mush. Some questions she felt confident about. Others were complete guesses. And there were at least three problems where she knew her approach was wrong but couldn't figure out the right way.

*If you'd just let me—* Faisal started.

*No.*

*You're going to fail.*

*Maybe.*

*That doesn't bother you?*

*Of course it bothers me! But cheating would bother me more.*

She felt his confusion and, underneath it, something like respect.

*You're very stubborn,* he observed.

*It's a family trait.*

*Areeba is stubborn too.*

*I know.*

At 12:55, Ayesha finished the last question—badly, but finished. She went back through the exam, checking her work where she could, fixing small arithmetic errors.

At 1:00, the proctor called time.

"Pencils down. Close your exam booklets and remain seated while we collect papers."

Ayesha set down her pencil and sagged back in her chair, exhausted.

*How do you think you did?* Faisal asked.

*Honestly? Maybe a 65. If I'm lucky.*

*You could have gotten 100.*

*But it wouldn't have been mine.*

The proctors moved through the aisles, collecting exams. When they took Ayesha's booklet, it felt like releasing a weight.

"You're dismissed."

Students began gathering their things and filing out. Ayesha packed up slowly, her mind already shifting to the next problem.

*Areeba's exam starts in an hour,* she thought to Faisal.

*I know.*

*We need to get you to her.*

*We need to get you closer to her,* he corrected. *I still can't jump this distance.*

Ayesha pulled out her phone as she walked out of the examination hall. Three missed texts from Areeba, sent over the last hour.

**Areeba (11:17):** *Do you have him?*

**Areeba (12:03):** *Ayesha please tell me you have him*

**Areeba (12:45):** *I need him back before my exam. Where are you?*

Guilt twisted in Ayesha's stomach. She quickly typed back:

**Ayesha:** *Just finished my exam. He's with me. He says he can't jump back because we're too far apart. I'm coming home now.*

She started walking quickly toward the parking lot where she'd left her car, then broke into a jog.

Her phone buzzed.

**Areeba:** *How long?*

**Ayesha:** *20 minutes. I'm hurrying.*

**Areeba:** *My exam is at 2. I need him back NOW.*

Ayesha's fingers froze over her phone screen.

Areeba's exam was at 2.

If Faisal went back to Areeba before her exam, she'd have him during the test. She'd cheat. The entire reason for this arrangement would be pointless.

**Ayesha:** *You can't have him back yet. Your exam is at 2. That's the whole point of this.*

**Areeba:** *I don't care. I NEED him.*

**Ayesha:** *Areeba, you'll cheat. You know you will.*

**Areeba:** *I won't. I promise I'll make him stay quiet.*

**Ayesha:** *You said that was impossible. That you couldn't turn him off.*

A long pause. Ayesha reached her car and fumbled with her keys, her hands shaking.

**Areeba:** *Please. I can't do this. It's been hours and I can't think straight.*

**Ayesha:** *I know. I'm sorry. But you have to take your exam first. Then you can have him back.*

**Areeba:** *I'll fail.*

**Ayesha:** *Maybe. But at least it will be honest.*

Another pause, longer this time.

**Areeba:** *I hate this.*

**Ayesha:** *I know. I'm so sorry.*

*She's panicking,* Faisal said quietly in Ayesha's mind.

*I know.*

*She hasn't been without me since Tuesday. This is the longest gap.*

*I know!*

Ayesha started the car and pulled out of the parking lot. The drive home felt interminable—every red light an eternity, every slow driver an obstacle.

*Tell me about her,* Ayesha said, trying to distract herself from the guilt. *What's she feeling?*

*I can't feel her when we're apart. I only know your emotions right now.*

*Which are?*

*Guilt. Anxiety. And underneath that, a happiness you're trying to suppress.*

*What?*

*You're happy to have me, even in these circumstances. Even knowing it's hurting your sister.*

Ayesha's hands tightened on the steering wheel.

*That's not fair.*

*I'm not judging. I'm just observing.*

*Well, observe something else.*

But he was right, and they both knew it. Despite everything—the stress of the exam, the panic about Areeba, the ethical dilemma—there was a part of Ayesha that was savoring these extra hours. Hoarding them like precious things.

She hated that part of herself.

But she couldn't deny it.

*What should I do?* Ayesha asked. *Should I go home or go to her campus?*

*Her campus,* Faisal said. *She needs to see you—to know I'm close, even if she can't have me yet. And after her exam, I can return to her immediately.*

*Okay.*

Ayesha changed direction, heading toward the campus where Areeba's exam would be held. Her phone buzzed again.

**Areeba:** *Where are you?*

**Ayesha:** *Coming to your campus. I'll wait for you. As soon as your exam is done, you can have him back.*

**Areeba:** *This is torture.*

**Ayesha:** *I know. I'm sorry.*

At 1:52, Ayesha pulled into the parking lot near the mathematics building. She spotted Areeba sitting on a bench outside, hunched over, her arms wrapped around herself.

Ayesha got out of the car and walked toward her sister.

Areeba looked up, and Ayesha's heart broke.

Her sister looked terrible. Face pale and drawn, eyes red-rimmed and desperate. She was dressed for her exam but looked like she could barely hold herself together.

"You're here," Areeba whispered.

"I'm here."

Areeba stood up shakily as Ayesha approached. "Can I—can I have him now? Please? Just for a minute before I go in?"

*She's close enough now,* Faisal said in Ayesha's mind. *I can jump.*

*Should I let you?* Ayesha asked him.

*That's not my decision.*

Ayesha looked at her sister—at the desperation and need written across her face.

"Your exam starts in eight minutes," Ayesha said gently. "If he goes to you now, you'll have him during the test."

"I won't cheat. I swear I won't—"

"You can't control it, remember? He can't help helping. That's what you told me."

Areeba's face crumpled. "I know. I know, but—" Her voice broke. "It hurts so much. Being empty like this. I didn't know it would hurt this much."

"I know," Ayesha said softly, and she did. She knew exactly how it felt.

"How long is your exam?"

"Two hours."

"Then in two hours, you can have him back. I'll wait right here. The second you come out, he's yours."

Areeba's hands clenched into fists. "I don't think I can do this."

"You can. You're strong enough."

"What if I fail?"

"Then you fail. But you'll fail honestly."

Tears spilled down Areeba's cheeks. "This was supposed to help. This arrangement. But it just hurts more."

Ayesha stepped closer, wanting to hug her sister but afraid that getting too close would make it harder. "It does help. You're not cheating. That's what you wanted."

"I know." Areeba wiped at her eyes. "I just—I didn't expect it to feel like this."

A bell rang somewhere inside the building. Two minutes to exam time.

"You need to go," Ayesha said.

"I can't."

"You can. Two hours. You can survive two hours."

Areeba looked at her—really looked at her—and something shifted in her expression. "You survive this all the time. Don't you? This emptiness."

"Yes."

"How?"

"Badly," Ayesha admitted. "But I survive."

Areeba took a shaky breath, then another. Straightening her shoulders like she was preparing for battle.

"Okay. Okay." She picked up her bag. "Two hours. You'll wait here?"

"Right here on this bench. I'm not going anywhere."

"And the second I come out—"

"The second you come out, he goes back to you. I promise."

Areeba nodded, not trusting herself to speak. She started toward the building entrance, then turned back.

"Thank you. For not giving in. For keeping me honest even when I'm begging."

"That's what sisters do."

After Areeba disappeared into the building, Ayesha sat down on the bench and let out a long breath.

*That was cruel,* Faisal said quietly.

*That was necessary.*

*She's suffering.*

*I know. But she'd suffer more if she cheated. The guilt would eat her alive.*

*You're very sure of that.*

*I'm sure of her,* Ayesha said. *She has a conscience. A strong one. That's why she came to me in the first place.*

*And you? Do you have a conscience?*

*I'm trying to.*

Ayesha settled in to wait, very aware of Faisal's presence in her mind. Two more hours of connection. Two hours she hadn't expected to have.

*You're savoring this,* Faisal observed. *Even knowing your sister is in pain.*

*I hate that I'm savoring this,* Ayesha corrected. *There's a difference.*

*Is there?*

*I think so. I hope so.*

They sat in silence—shared silence, which wasn't really silence at all—while Areeba struggled through her exam alone.

And Ayesha tried not to feel guilty about the small, selfish part of her that was grateful for the mistake that had given her these extra hours.

Tried and failed.

At 4:07, students began streaming out of the mathematics building. Ayesha stood up, scanning the crowd for her sister.

Areeba emerged at 4:11, walking slowly, her face exhausted but composed.

The moment she saw Ayesha, her pace quickened.

"Is he—"

"Right here," Ayesha said.

Areeba stopped a few feet away, and Ayesha felt Faisal stir in her mind.

*She's close enough,* he said.

*Go,* Ayesha told him. *She needs you more than I do.*

*Do you really believe that?*

*It doesn't matter what I believe. She's the one he belongs to.*

A pause, weighted with something Ayesha couldn't name.

*You're stronger than you think,* Faisal said.

*I'm really not.*

*You did well today. Refusing to cheat. Making Areeba wait. Those were hard choices.*

*They were the only choices.*

*That doesn't make them less hard. Or less brave.*

*Just go,* Ayesha thought, her throat tight. *Before I change my mind about being brave.*

Then he was gone.

The emptiness hit like a physical blow. Ayesha steadied herself against the bench and watched as Areeba's whole body transformed.

Color flooded back into her face. Her breathing evened out. She closed her eyes and pressed both hands to her chest, and a sound escaped her—half sob, half laugh, pure relief.

When Areeba opened her eyes again, they were wet with tears.

"Oh god," she whispered. "Oh thank god."

She swayed slightly, and Ayesha stepped forward to steady her.

"You okay?"

"No. Yes. I don't know." Areeba gripped Ayesha's arm. "That was—I can't do that again. I can't."

"How was the exam?"

"Awful. I couldn't concentrate. Every problem felt impossible. I probably failed." Areeba shook her head. "But at least I failed honestly."

"Yeah."

They stood there in the late afternoon sun, two sisters recovering from different kinds of pain.

"I'm sorry," Areeba said finally. "For forgetting to take him back last night. For making you deal with this mess."

"It's okay."

"And I'm sorry you had to keep him during my exam. I know that made it harder. Having him longer, then losing him again."

Ayesha couldn't deny that, so she didn't try.

"Come on," she said instead. "Let's go home."

They walked to their cars in silence. Areeba looked stronger with each step—more solid, more present. Whole again.

And Ayesha felt more hollow with each step—lighter, emptier. Incomplete.

Two more exams this week. Two more transfers. Two more cycles of connection and loss.

She could survive this.

She had to.

Because the alternative—asking Areeba to stop, to let Faisal stay with her, to share him permanently—would mean crossing a line she'd promised not to cross.

And Ayesha had so few promises left to keep.

So she'd keep this one.

Even if it killed her.
