# CHAPTER 20: PURE SOUL

Three days had passed since the ice cream incident. Three days of careful avoidance and uncomfortable family dinners where no one mentioned ghosts or possession or the impossible thing living in Areeba's head.

Ayesha had retreated into something that looked like acceptance. She went to her summer job at the campus library, came home, ate dinner, and disappeared into her room. She stopped hovering around Areeba. Stopped watching her with that hungry, hollow look.

She seemed... fine.

Areeba didn't trust it.

"She's gotten used to it," Areeba said aloud, lying on her bed Thursday afternoon. "To not having you."

*Perhaps,* Faisal replied. *Or perhaps she's simply learned to hide the wanting better.*

"Which one do you think it is?"

*Does it matter?*

"Of course it matters. If she's actually okay, then that means it's possible. To be okay without you."

*And that frightens you.*

Areeba didn't answer, because he was right. The idea that someone could feel what she felt—that completeness, that connection—and then just... let it go? Move on?

It was incomprehensible. And if Ayesha could do it, what did that say about Areeba's own desperate clinging?

A knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Areeba? Can I come in?" Mama's voice.

Areeba sat up, instantly wary. "Why?"

"I just want to talk."

*Trap,* Faisal said quietly in her mind.

*You think?*

*I think your mother hasn't forgotten what she experienced. And I think she wants to experience it again.*

Areeba's stomach clenched. "Come in."

The door opened and Mama stepped inside, closing it behind her. She looked... different. Lighter, somehow. Almost excited, though she was trying to hide it.

"How are you feeling, beta?" Mama asked, sitting on the edge of the bed.

"Fine."

"And... Faisal? Is he...?"

"He's here."

Mama's expression softened into something that made Areeba deeply uncomfortable. A sort of gentle, affectionate warmth.

"Faisal," Mama said, her voice going soft and coaxing. "My boy. Come to Mama."

Areeba's face twisted in disgust. "Eww, stop it, Mama."

"What? I'm just—"

"You're talking to him like he's a baby. Like he's some kind of pet." Areeba shook her head. "It's weird."

But even as she said it, she felt Faisal stir in her mind. A pull toward Mama. Interest.

*Don't you dare,* Areeba thought fiercely.

*She wants to talk,* Faisal said. *There's no harm in—*

*You are not going anywhere.*

"We just want to have a conversation," Mama said, still in that gentle voice. "We didn't get to finish our discussion the other night. There was so much more to talk about."

*Her soul is so pure,* Faisal said, and there was something in his mental voice that Areeba had never heard before. Wonder. Attraction.

Areeba went very still.

*Are you—* She couldn't even finish the thought. Couldn't bring herself to ask if he was *flirting* with her mother.

"We were just having a discussion scheduled for tomorrow," Mama continued. "Weren't we, Faisal?"

In Areeba's mind, Faisal confirmed: *I did promise to explain some things to her. About engineering principles. She was so eager to learn.*

"See?" Mama smiled. "He promised."

"He can explain things to you through me," Areeba said quickly. "You can ask questions and I'll relay his answers."

"That's not the same and you know it."

"Too bad."

Mama's expression shifted. The gentleness hardened into something more determined. "Faisal. Come to me. Or I will do something to force you out."

Areeba's jaw dropped. "That's blackmail, Mama!"

"I prefer to think of it as negotiating."

"You can't just threaten to—to exorcise him because he won't do what you want!"

"Can't I?" Mama's voice was calm, but there was steel underneath. "I'm trying to be respectful, Areeba. I'm asking nicely. But I am still your mother, and this is still my house, and if I decide that having an entity in my daughter's head is dangerous, I have every right to take action."

"You promised you wouldn't try to take him away!"

"And I'm not. I'm just asking to borrow him for a while. Surely you can spare him for one afternoon?"

But Areeba could hear the lie underneath. The too-casual tone. The hunger that Mama was trying to hide.

This wasn't about a simple conversation. This was about Mama wanting to feel whole again. Wanting to experience what she'd lost when Faisal left her.

She was just as hooked as Areeba was. After twenty minutes.

*I should go,* Faisal said quietly. *She's threatening you because of me. I don't want to cause conflict in your family.*

*Don't you dare leave me for her.*

*It's not leaving. It's just a temporary transfer.*

*That's what you said last time, and she kept you for ages. I was falling apart, Faisal. I can't do that again.*

*You're stronger than you think.*

*I'm really not.*

But she could feel him pulling away. Drawn to Mama's pure soul, her eagerness to learn, her gentle coaxing.

Drawn away from Areeba.

"Fine," Areeba bit out. "Fine. Take him. But only for an hour."

"Two hours," Mama countered.

"One and a half."

"Deal."

Mama smiled, and Areeba hated how excited she looked. Like a child promised a treat.

*Traitor,* Areeba thought at Faisal.

*I'm sorry,* he replied. *I'll be back soon. I promise.*

And then he was gone.

The transfer was smoother this time—Areeba had been expecting it, bracing for it. But that didn't make the emptiness any less devastating.

One moment: whole. The next: hollow.

She watched Mama's face transform as Faisal filled her. The same wonder and joy as before. The same completeness.

"Hello again," Mama whispered, and smiled.

Then her eyes went distant and Areeba knew they were talking, having conversations she wasn't part of, sharing thoughts and ideas and connection that belonged to her.

The jealousy was corrosive. It burned through Areeba's chest, mixing with the withdrawal, making everything worse.

"Two hours," Areeba said tightly. "That's all you get."

But Mama wasn't listening anymore. She was already lost in whatever Faisal was showing her, teaching her, explaining to her.

Mama stood up and walked toward the door, still with that distant, blissful expression.

"Wait, where are you going?" Areeba demanded.

"Downstairs. I want to look at my old engineering textbooks while he explains the concepts."

"You can do that here."

"I don't need your permission, Areeba." Mama's voice was gentle but firm. "He's with me now. We'll be downstairs if you need us."

And she left, taking Faisal with her.

Areeba sat on her bed, alone in her room, and tried very hard not to fall apart.

*Don't think about it,* she told herself. *The more you think about the withdrawal, the worse it gets. Mind over matter. You can handle this.*

She took a deep breath. Let it out slowly.

*I'm fine. I don't need him. This is fine.*

But even as she thought it, the emptiness grew sharper. The hollow ache spread through her chest, her limbs, her mind.

*The more you think about it, the more you get it,* Areeba realized with growing despair. *The more you try to convince yourself you're okay, the more you notice how not-okay you are.*

It was like trying not to think about a white elephant. The effort itself made it impossible.

She grabbed her phone, desperate for distraction. Scrolled through social media without seeing any of it. Put on music, but the songs sounded flat and colorless without Faisal there to share them with.

Ten minutes had passed. Felt like an hour.

*I can't do this,* Areeba thought. *I can't sit here for two hours feeling like this.*

She stood up, paced the room. Tried to read a book. Gave up after three pages when she realized she hadn't absorbed a single word.

*This is pathetic,* part of her mind observed clinically. *You're an adult woman having a breakdown because you can't be without someone for two hours.*

But knowing it was pathetic didn't make it better. Didn't make the ache go away.

She found herself at her bedroom door, one hand on the knob. She could go downstairs. Could watch Mama and Faisal together. At least then she'd be near him, even if he wasn't hers.

*That would be even worse,* the rational part of her brain supplied. *Watching them together. Seeing what you're missing.*

She let go of the doorknob and returned to the bed.

Fifteen minutes. 

The house was too quiet. Areeba could hear the murmur of voices from downstairs—Mama talking to Faisal, probably out loud since there was no one else around to hear.

What were they discussing? What was he teaching her? Was he using that patient, encouraging tone he used when he explained things? The one that made Areeba feel brilliant and capable?

Was he giving Mama the same warmth, the same attention, the same care?

The jealousy twisted deeper.

Twenty minutes.

Areeba heard footsteps in the hallway. For a moment her heart leaped—maybe Mama was bringing him back early.

But the footsteps passed her door and continued to Ayesha's room. A door opened and closed.

Ayesha was home from work.

Ayesha, who had supposedly gotten used to not having Faisal. Who had moved on.

*How?* Areeba wondered desperately. *How did she do it?*

She couldn't ask. Couldn't admit to her sister that she was falling apart after twenty minutes of separation. That would be admitting weakness. Admitting that maybe Ayesha was stronger than her.

Twenty-five minutes.

Areeba pulled her knees to her chest, wrapped her arms around them. Made herself as small as possible, as if she could compress the emptiness that way.

*This is temporary,* she reminded herself. *He's coming back. Mama promised. One and a half hours and he's coming back.*

But what if Mama changed her mind? What if she decided she wanted to keep him longer? What if she pulled the same stunt as before, making excuses, saying just a few more minutes, until those minutes stretched into hours?

What if she never gave him back?

The panic rose sharp and fast. Areeba's breathing quickched, her heart pounding.

*She can't keep him forever. He'll come back to me. He always comes back to me.*

But did he? Or did he only come back because Areeba begged and pleaded and fell apart so dramatically that guilt forced him to return?

What if Mama didn't fall apart? What if she could enjoy his presence calmly, reasonably, without desperate need? Would he prefer that? Would he choose to stay with someone who didn't cling so hard?

*Her soul is so pure.*

He'd never said that about Areeba.

Thirty minutes.

Areeba lay down on her bed, curled on her side, and stared at the wall. Tried to empty her mind completely. If she thought about nothing, maybe she'd feel nothing.

It didn't work.

The absence was too loud. The silence in her head too complete.

She'd gotten so used to having someone there. Having thoughts that weren't just her own. Having a constant companion, a steady presence, a voice that filled the empty spaces.

Without it, she was just... herself. Alone. Small. Insufficient.

The tears came quietly, leaking from the corners of her eyes.

She was pathetic. She knew she was pathetic. But knowing didn't help.

Forty-five minutes.

Another hour to go.

Areeba didn't know if she'd survive it.

---

Downstairs, Faiza sat at the kitchen table, three engineering textbooks spread out in front of her, and smiled as Faisal walked her through a concept she'd struggled with twenty-five years ago.

It was brilliant. He was brilliant. The way he could take something complex and make it simple, make it clear, make her feel capable of understanding it—it was intoxicating.

She'd forgotten what this felt like. Being a student. Being excited about learning.

Being seen by someone who cared about teaching.

*Your daughter is struggling,* Faisal said gently in her mind.

*She'll be fine. It hasn't even been an hour yet.*

*She won't be fine. You know what the withdrawal feels like.*

Faiza did know. That awful emptiness when Faisal had left her three days ago. But she'd only had him for twenty minutes. Surely it wasn't as bad for her as it was for Areeba.

*It's worse for her,* Faisal said, reading her thoughts. *Because she's had me for months. The attachment is deeper.*

*Then maybe this is good for her. Learning to cope without you for a while.*

*You don't believe that.*

He was right. She didn't. But she wanted to believe it, because the alternative was admitting that she was hurting her daughter just to satisfy her own craving.

And it was a craving. Faiza could admit that now, in the privacy of her own mind. 

She wanted this. Wanted him. Wanted the brilliance and clarity and completeness he brought.

Wanted to feel like she mattered again. Like her mind was worth nurturing.

*This isn't healthy,* Faisal said quietly. *For any of us.*

*I know.*

*Then why are you doing this?*

Faiza didn't have a good answer for that. Or rather, she had an answer, but it wasn't one she was proud of.

Because it felt good. Because she'd spent twenty-five years being just a mother, just a wife, her own dreams and ambitions buried under diapers and school runs and family dinners.

And here was something that was just for her. Something that made her feel alive and brilliant and seen.

She wasn't ready to give that up. Not yet.

Even if it meant her daughter was upstairs falling apart.

*Just a little longer,* Faiza thought. *Just a little more time.*

But she could feel Faisal's disapproval like a weight in her mind. His disappointment.

And underneath that: his pull toward Areeba. The connection drawing him back to the girl who needed him most.

The hour-and-a-half deadline was going to come whether Faiza wanted it to or not.

She turned the page in her textbook and tried to ignore the guilt eating at her.

*Just a little longer.*
