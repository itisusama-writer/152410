**Creative Writing Task:**
I am writing a **fictional thriller novel**, set in a university environment. Please write **Chapter 1** of this story using vivid sensory detail and rising tension, without including any explicit violence or graphic injury.
**Scene Summary:**

* **Time:** Early Morning (8:00–9:00 AM)
* **Season:** Winter
* **Setting:** University of Lahore (UOL)
* **Main Character:** Rimsha Rizvi, a medical student

**Plot Notes:**
Rimsha attends her morning class in Section A2. Only her friend Sana and a few students are there when two strangers in black jackets enter the university, seemingly looking for someone. They reach the classroom, clearly targeting Rimsha, who tries to get away in panic. Something goes wrong, she falls and injures herself slightly. One of them demands something mysterious called *the console*. She denies having it. Before they can act further, a call interrupts them, and they leave with a warning that they’ll return.

**Tone:** Suspenseful, cinematic, and full of sensory atmosphere (winter air, early light, echoing footsteps, tension of a confined classroom). Avoid graphic content, focus on fear, confusion, and mystery.
