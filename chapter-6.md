# CHAPTER THREE: THE PACT

Morning light filtered through the curtains of Room 9, soft and golden. Ayesha woke to the sound of the azaan again, but this time she didn't feel peaceful. She'd barely slept, kept awake by the knowledge of what—*who*—lay in the bed across from her.

She turned her head slowly, dreading what she'd see.

Areeba was already awake, sitting up in bed, stretching her arms above her head with a yawn. When she lowered them, she looked over and caught Ayesha staring.

"Good morning!" Areeba's voice was bright, cheerful. Normal.

Ayesha's stomach clenched. Which one was this? Areeba or...?

"Morning," Ayesha managed, her voice rough with sleep and suspicion.

Areeba swung her legs out of bed and padded to the mirror, examining her reflection. She touched her face gently, ran her fingers through her tangled hair, studied herself with an expression Ayesha couldn't quite read. Not the strange, exploratory way a guy had looked at himself yesterday. This was different. Familiar. Like someone checking to make sure they were still themselves.

"How did you sleep?" Areeba asked, still looking at the mirror.

"Fine," Ayesha lied. "You?"

"Like the dead." Areeba laughed at her own joke, then paused, her smile faltering slightly. "Sorry. Bad choice of words."

Aunt Fareeda stirred in her bed, groaning. "What time is it?"

"Early," Aunt Sadia mumbled from under her pillow. "Too early."

"Uncle Jamil said we're leaving for Babusar Top at eight," Areeba said, turning from the mirror. "We should start getting ready."

Her movements were fluid, natural. She walked to her suitcase and knelt beside it, pulling out clothes with the careful consideration Areeba always used. A blue kameez with white embroidery. Matching pants. A coordinating dupatta.

Not the random, clashing outfit from yesterday.

Ayesha watched her, trying to understand. Yesterday morning, that Areeba had fumbled with the clothes, grabbed things randomly, didn't know how to braid hair. But now, Areeba was selecting an outfit with practiced ease.

"I'm going to shower first," Areeba announced, gathering her things. "If no one minds?"

"Go ahead, beta," Aunt Fareeda said, sitting up and rubbing her eyes.

Areeba disappeared into the bathroom, and Ayesha heard the water start running. She stared at the closed door, her mind racing.

Was that Areeba? The real Areeba? Or was the guy getting better at pretending?

The morning passed in the usual chaos of getting ready. Areeba emerged from the shower looking fresh and put together—her hair neatly braided (she'd done it herself, Ayesha noted), light makeup applied with a practiced hand, outfit coordinated and appropriate.

She looked like Areeba.

She moved like Areeba.

She talked like Areeba, chatting with the aunts about what to pack for the day trip, laughing at Aunt Sadia's complaint about her aching back from yesterday's jeep ride.

But Ayesha couldn't trust it. Couldn't believe it. Not after last night's threat.

They made their way downstairs for breakfast. The hotel restaurant was small but busy, filled with tourists fueling up for their day trips. The smell of parathas and chai filled the air, mixing with the mountain breeze coming through open windows.

The family claimed two tables pushed together. Uncle Jamil was already there with the male cousins, nursing cups of tea and looking at maps on someone's phone.

"Babusar Top is three hours from here," Uncle Jamil explained as the women joined them. "Maybe four with stops. It's 13,691 feet—much higher than Saif-ul-Malook. The views are supposed to be incredible."

"More jeep rides," Aunt Sadia said mournfully. "My back hasn't recovered from yesterday."

"Think of it as a massage," Uncle Tariq said with a grin. "A very aggressive, uncomfortable massage."

Everyone laughed. Even Areeba, her laugh light and genuine.

Ayesha picked at her paratha, barely tasting it. She watched Areeba interact with the family—passing salt to Uncle Jamil, joking with Faizan about his terrible sense of direction, helping little Hiba cut her omelet.

Normal. Everything was so normal.

After breakfast, they gathered in the lobby to wait for the jeeps. Ayesha found herself standing near Areeba, who was adjusting her dupatta and checking her small backpack.

"Can we talk?" Ayesha said quietly. "Alone?"

Areeba looked at her, and for just a moment, something flickered in her eyes. Hesitation? Fear? "Sure."

They stepped away from the group, moving to a quiet corner near the stairs. Ayesha waited until they were out of earshot before speaking.

"Who am I talking to?" she asked bluntly.

Areeba's expression didn't change, but her hands stilled on her backpack strap. "What do you mean?"

"You know what I mean. Are you Areeba? Or are you... him?"

A long pause. Then Areeba smiled—but it was a sad smile, complicated. "I'm Areeba."

Relief flooded through Ayesha. "Are you okay? Did he hurt you? Can you—"

"I'm also Faisal."

The relief died instantly.

Ayesha stared at her. "What?"

Areeba—or whoever she was—glanced around to make sure no one was listening. When she spoke again, her voice was low, urgent. "It's hard to explain. We made an arrangement. A pact."

"A pact," Ayesha repeated, her voice flat. "You made a deal with the thing possessing you."

"He's not possessing me anymore. Not exactly." Areeba's hands twisted together. "We're... sharing. He gets time, I get time. We switch."

"That's insane. That's—you can't just share a body like it's a timeshare apartment!"

"What choice did I have?" Areeba's voice rose slightly, took on a defensive edge. Then she caught herself, lowered it again. "He was taking over completely. Pushing me down. I was disappearing, Ayesha. I could feel myself getting smaller, weaker. So I... I made a deal. We share. He lets me come back, lets me have control sometimes, and I let him stay."

"Let him stay?" Ayesha grabbed Areeba's arm. "Are you hearing yourself? You let a—a spirit, a demon, whatever he is—you let him stay in your body?"

Areeba pulled her arm free, and suddenly her expression changed. Hardened. When she spoke again, the voice was different—deeper, more masculine, even though the pitch was the same.

"She didn't have a choice," Faisal said from Areeba's mouth. "I would have taken everything. At least this way, she gets to live."

Ayesha stumbled back, horror washing over her. "You—you're both in there right now?"

"Always." The voice shifted again—lighter now, definitely Areeba. "We're always both here. We just... take turns at the front."

"This is wrong," Ayesha breathed. "This is so wrong."

"It's survival," Faisal said, taking control again. His eyes—Areeba's eyes but with that cold, male assessment—studied Ayesha. "You should be grateful. Your cousin is alive. She's here. She can still laugh, talk, be with her family. That's more than she'd have if I'd consumed her completely."

"Give Areeba back," Ayesha demanded, trying to keep her voice steady. "All the way back. Get out of her body."

"No." Simple. Final.

"Ayesha, please—" Areeba's voice returned, pleading. "Please don't make this harder. I know it's weird, I know it's scary, but we've figured out how to make it work. He does the hard stuff—"

"I do the difficult physical things," Faisal interjected. "The climbing, the carrying, anything that requires strength she doesn't have."

"—and I get to be myself for the normal things," Areeba continued. "The family time. The fun parts. It's not perfect, but it's better than the alternative."

Ayesha felt like she was going insane. She was watching her cousin's face cycle through expressions, hearing two different people speak from the same mouth, seeing the shift in posture and mannerism as control changed hands.

"How can you be okay with this?" Ayesha asked Areeba. "How can you just... accept sharing your body with a stranger?"

Areeba's expression softened with something like sympathy. "Because I don't want to die. I don't want to disappear. And because—" she hesitated, "—it's not as bad as you think. He's not evil. He's just... lost. He was trapped for so long, and now he can finally experience things again. Feel things. Live."

"Through your body!"

"Yes. Through my body." Areeba reached out and took Ayesha's hands. Her grip was warm, familiar. "I know this is hard to understand. I barely understand it myself. But we've worked something out. We have rules. Boundaries. He lets me have the times that matter—being with family, having fun, being myself. And I let him have the times when I need him—when things are hard, when I need to be strong, when—"

She cut herself off, but Ayesha caught the implication. When she needed to do things Areeba couldn't or wouldn't normally do.

"This is insane," Ayesha whispered. "You know this is insane, right?"

"Maybe," Areeba admitted. Then her expression changed again—that subtle shift that meant Faisal was speaking. "But it's our reality now. And you need to accept it."

"I don't need to accept anything!"

"SHUT UP." 

The words came out harsh, sharp—but Areeba's hand flew to her own mouth, her eyes wide with shock. When she lowered it, she was glaring at nothing, at the air, at herself.

"Let me talk to her," Areeba hissed to herself. "This is my cousin. My family. Let me handle this."

Watching someone argue with themselves was surreal in a way Ayesha couldn't quite process. Areeba's face shifted through micro-expressions—anger, frustration, pleading—her lips moving silently as if having an internal conversation.

Which, Ayesha realized with creeping horror, she was.

Finally, Areeba's expression settled. She looked at Ayesha with tired eyes.

"I'm sorry," she said quietly. "We're still... figuring out the boundaries. He gets protective sometimes."

"Protective," Ayesha repeated numbly.

"He thinks you're going to try to separate us. Exorcise him or something." Areeba managed a weak smile. "But I told him you wouldn't. Because you understand that I'm choosing this. Right?"

The question hung between them, heavy with implication. If Ayesha tried to "save" Areeba against her will, she'd be betraying her cousin's choice. But if she accepted this arrangement, she'd be allowing something unnatural to continue.

Before Ayesha could answer, Uncle Jamil's voice boomed across the lobby.

"Jeeps are here! Everyone ready?"

The family began moving toward the doors in a flurry of activity. Backpacks, cameras, water bottles. The children were already racing outside, excited for another adventure.

Areeba squeezed Ayesha's hands once more. "Please," she whispered. "Don't tell anyone. Don't try to fix this. It's working. I promise it's working."

Then she let go and turned toward the group, her face brightening into a smile as Hiba grabbed her hand and pulled her toward the door.

"Areeba apa, sit with me in the jeep!" the little girl demanded.

"Of course!" Areeba said, her voice full of warmth and affection. Completely normal. Completely herself.

Ayesha followed slowly, her mind reeling.

As they stepped out into the bright morning sunshine, she heard it—Areeba's voice, barely a whisper, talking to herself as she walked.

"You do the hard stuff when we get there, okay? The climbing, the altitude. Let me be myself right now. I'll give you control back when we reach the top."

A pause. Then, in that slightly different tone:

"Fair enough. But when it's time for the difficult parts, you step aside."

"Deal."

They were negotiating. Making plans. Dividing up the day like two people sharing a shift.

Ayesha felt sick.

The jeeps waited outside, engines rumbling. The same battered Land Cruisers from yesterday, the drivers already looking resigned to another day of tourists and mountain roads.

"Same groups!" Uncle Jamil announced. "Let's move!"

Ayesha climbed into the jeep, taking her seat by the window. Aunt Fareeda settled beside her. Aunt Sadia took the front. And Areeba slid into the seat on Aunt Fareeda's other side, next to little Hiba.

As the jeep pulled away from Lalazar Hotel and merged into Naran Bazaar's morning traffic, Ayesha stared out the window, watching the mountains loom larger as they headed north.

Babusar Top. 13,691 feet. Even higher than yesterday. Thinner air. Harder terrain.

Perfect conditions for Areeba to need Faisal's strength.

Perfect conditions for him to take control.

Ayesha glanced over at her cousin, who was braiding Hiba's hair, her fingers moving with practiced ease, her face soft with concentration and affection.

This was Areeba. Her cousin. Her sister in all but blood.

But she was also Faisal. A stranger. An intruder. An entity that had no right to be there.

And somehow, impossibly, they were working together.

*You do the hard stuff, and let me be myself.*

Ayesha closed her eyes, leaning her head against the jeep window as they climbed out of the valley and into the higher mountains.

She had no idea what to do. No idea how to fix this. No idea if it even could be fixed—or if Areeba even wanted it to be.

All she knew was that the trip to Babusar Top was going to change everything.

She could feel it in her bones.

The mountains knew it too. As they climbed higher, leaving the green valley behind for starker, more barren peaks, Ayesha could have sworn the mountains were watching.

Waiting.

To see what would happen when Areeba and Faisal were tested at the roof of the world.
