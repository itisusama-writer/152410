# Chapter 4 - Saif-ul-Muluk
---
The hallway was narrow, dimly lit by a single bulb that flickered intermittently. The wooden floorboards creaked under their feet as the women emerged from Room 9. Uncle Jamil stood with his arms crossed, Uncle Tariq beside him checking his watch. The male cousins, Faizan, Hamza, and Bilal—lounged against the wall, scrolling through their phones even though there was barely any signal.

"Finally!" Uncle Jamil said. "We were about to send a search party."

"Sorry, sorry," Aunt Fareeda said, adjusting her dupatta. "Someone took forever getting ready."

Areeba stepped out last, and Ayesha watched—really watched—as her cousin's entire demeanor shifted.

Her shoulders straightened. Her stride changed. Instead of the small, careful steps women took in shalwar kameez, Areeba walked with a longer gait, her hips straight instead of swaying, her arms swinging loose at her sides. Confident. Almost swaggering.

Like a boy.

"Hey, bro!" Areeba called out, her voice loud and cheerful as she approached the male cousins.

Everyone froze.

Faizan looked up from his phone, his eyebrows shooting toward his hairline. "Uh... good morning to you too?"

"Areeba," Aunt Sadia hissed. "What are you."

But Areeba was already striding toward Hamza, her hand extended. Not in a delicate handshake, but palm up, fingers spread—ready for a high-five or a handshake that would involve gripping, not just touching.

Hamza stared at her hand like it might bite him.

"You... want to shake hands?" he asked uncertainly.

"Yeah! Yeah, let's go!" Areeba grabbed his hand and shook it vigorously, pumping it up and down with an enthusiasm that made Hamza stumble backward. "Ready for today? Going to be awesome, right?"

"I... sure?" Hamza extracted his hand, glancing at his brothers with a look that clearly said *is she okay?*

Bilal, the youngest at sixteen, couldn't hide his smirk. "Someone's in a weird mood."

"Weird? This is not weird!" Areeba clapped him on the shoulder—hard—and Bilal actually winced. "This is excited! Come on, bro, lighten up!"

"Bro," Bilal repeated, his smirk widening. "Did Areeba just call me bro?"

"Maybe she hit her head harder than we thought," Faizan muttered.

Uncle Jamil cleared his throat. "Well. Shall we go then? The jeeps are waiting."

They made their way down the stairs—narrow and steep, the wood worn smooth by years of footsteps. Areeba took them two at a time, her dupatta sliding off her shoulder and dragging behind her like a forgotten accessory. Aunt Fareeda scrambled to keep up.

"Slow down, beta! You'll trip!"

But Areeba didn't slow down. She practically bounded down the stairs, hit the landing, spun around the banister post, and continued down the next flight with the energy of an overexcited puppy.

Ayesha descended more carefully, watching her cousin's every move. The way Areeba held herself. The way she moved through space. It was all wrong. Areeba had always been graceful, conscious of her movements in the way women learned to be—keeping her dupatta in place, watching where she stepped, moving through the world aware of the space her body occupied.

This Areeba moved like she'd never worn women's clothes before. Like she didn't know she was supposed to.

They emerged into the hotel's small lobby. Morning sunlight streamed through the windows, illuminating dust motes that danced in the air. The smell of chai and parathas wafted from the restaurant, mixing with the crisp mountain air coming through the open door.

Two jeeps waited outside—battered Toyota Land Cruisers with faded green paint and tires caked in mountain mud. The drivers stood beside them, both lean men in their forties with weathered faces and traditional pakol caps.

Areeba walked straight up to the nearest driver.

"Hey, man!" she said, and before Ayesha could process what was happening, Areeba extended her fist.

The driver stared at it.

"Uh..." he said.

Areeba bounced her fist up and down encouragingly. "Come on! Fist bump!"

Slowly, looking utterly confused, the driver raised his own fist and bumped it against Areeba's. She pulled back and made an exploding gesture with her fingers, complete with sound effects.

"Boom! Yeah! Going to be a great day, right?"

The driver looked at Uncle Jamil. Uncle Jamil looked at Aunt Fareeda. Aunt Fareeda looked at the sky, probably praying for patience.

"She's... feeling better," Uncle Jamil said weakly. "From yesterday."

"This is better?" Aunt Sadia whispered to Ayesha. "This?"

Ayesha didn't answer. She was watching Areeba, who had moved on to inspecting the jeep with intense interest, running her hands along the hood, peering at the tires, even kicking one experimentally.

"Nice ride," Areeba announced. "Very rugged. I like it."

"You like it," Faizan repeated, his tone flat. "You. Who cried when we went off-roading last year because you were worried about your makeup."

Areeba looked at him blankly. "Did I?"

"You literally made us stop so you could fix your lipstick."

"Huh." Areeba shrugged, a loose, one-shouldered gesture. "Well, I'm different now."

"You can say that again," Bilal muttered.

"Okay, everyone in!" Uncle Jamil called, clearly eager to move past this weirdness. "Same groups as we planned. Ladies and kids in jeep one, men in jeep two. Let's go!"

The family began sorting themselves out. Ayesha ended up climbing into the first jeep, choosing a seat by the window. Aunt Fareeda settled in beside her, with Aunt Sadia taking the front passenger seat. The two younger kids—Hiba and little Zayn—squeezed into the back row.

That left one seat. Next to Ayesha.

Areeba hauled herself into the jeep with zero grace, nearly kicking Hiba in the process. She dropped into the seat beside Ayesha, her legs spread wide, taking up more than her fair share of space. Her dupatta had slipped entirely off her head and lay bunched around her shoulders like a forgotten scarf.

"This is great!" Areeba declared. "Adventure time!"

The driver climbed into his seat, started the engine with a roar, and they lurched forward. The second jeep followed close behind, its horn beeping cheerfully.

They navigated through Naran Bazaar—still waking up, shopkeepers rolling up metal shutters, street vendors setting up their carts of corn and chai. Tourists were already emerging, cameras in hand, ready to capture the mountain magic.

The jeep turned onto the road leading up to Saif-ul-Malook, and immediately the smooth pavement gave way to rough gravel and dirt. The vehicle bounced and jolted, throwing everyone around.

"Sorry, sorry!" the driver called back. "Road is very bad this season!"

Aunt Sadia gripped the handle above her door, her knuckles white. Hiba and Zayn squealed with a mix of terror and delight at each particularly violent bump.

And Areeba laughed.

That same loud, uninhibited laugh from this morning. She braced her hands against the seat in front of her and the roof, absorbing the shocks like she was on a carnival ride, grinning from ear to ear.

"This is amazing!" she shouted over the engine noise. "Look at this view!"

Ayesha had to admit, the view was stunning. The road climbed steeply, switchback after switchback, and with each turn the valley opened up below them—the Kunhar River a silver thread far below, Naran Bazar shrinking to toy-town proportions, the mountains rising in layers of green and gray and white.

But she couldn't enjoy it. Not while Areeba sat beside her, legs still spread like a man's, one arm hanging out the window like she was in some American road trip movie, completely unselfconscious in a way the real Areeba had never been.

"Are you feeling okay?" Ayesha asked quietly, leaning close so only Areeba could hear.

Areeba turned to her, that bright smile still plastered on her face. "Why does everyone keep asking that? I feel great! Best I've ever felt!"

"It's just... you're acting different."

"Different how?"

Ayesha gestured vaguely at... all of her. "Just different."

"Well, maybe yesterday changed me," Areeba said, and for just a moment, something flickered in her eyes. Something that wasn't quite human. "Maybe I'm seeing things more clearly now."

Before Ayesha could respond, the jeep hit a massive pothole and everyone went airborne for a second before crashing back down. Zayn yelped. Aunt Fareeda gasped. Aunt Sadia started praying audibly.

And Areeba whooped like she was on a rollercoaster.

"Again!" she shouted to the driver. "Do that again!"

"There will be many more, I promise!" the driver called back, grinning despite himself.

They climbed higher. The pine forests grew denser, the air colder and thinner. Ayesha could feel it in her lungs—each breath taking slightly more effort. Aunt Fareeda pulled out a shawl and wrapped it around her shoulders. Hiba complained that her ears hurt.

"That's the altitude," the driver explained. "We're at 10,000 feet now. The lake is at 10,500. Yawn and it will help with the pressure."

Everyone dutifully yawned, their ears popping. Everyone except Areeba, who continued to stare out the window with rapt attention, seemingly unaffected by the altitude change.

An hour into the journey, they stopped at a small viewpoint where both jeeps could pull over. Everyone needed to stretch, use the makeshift bathroom facilities (a terrifying wooden structure perched over a cliff), and give their bodies a break from the constant jostling.

Ayesha climbed out of the jeep on shaky legs, her back aching and her head starting to pound from the altitude. Around her, the family emerged looking similarly battered. Aunt Sadia immediately sat on a rock, fanning herself. Uncle Jamil grimaced as he stretched his back. The male cousins looked pale and slightly green.

"I hate mountain roads," Hamza groaned. "I think I'm going to be sick."

"Don't you dare," Faizan said. "We still have the ride back."

And then there was Areeba.

She jumped out of the jeep like she'd been sitting in an air-conditioned room, not a rattling metal box on a road designed by sadists. Her eyes were bright, her color good, her movements energetic.

"Come on, everyone!" She gestured to the viewpoint overlook. "Let's go check out the view! It's incredible!"

"How are you so energetic?" Bilal demanded. "You fainted three times yesterday!"

"I feel great!" Areeba jogged—actually jogged—toward the overlook.

Ayesha watched her go, a frown deepening on her face. She felt like she'd been put through a blender. How was Areeba fine?

They spent fifteen minutes at the viewpoint, taking photos and letting their bodies recover before the final leg to the lake. By the time they piled back into the jeeps, Ayesha's headache had bloomed into a full migraine, courtesy of the altitude.

Aunt Fareeda offered her some pills. "For the headache. The altitude affects everyone differently."

But as Ayesha swallowed the pills with water from a plastic bottle, she looked at Areeba—completely unaffected, practically vibrating with energy—and wondered.

If altitude affected everyone differently, why didn't it affect Areeba at all?

---

Saif-ul-Malook Lake appeared suddenly, like a jewel revealed when a curtain is pulled back.

One moment they were navigating yet another tight switchback through pine trees, and the next—there it was. A vast expanse of glacial water, impossibly blue-green, ringed by snow-capped peaks that seemed to scrape the sky. The lake's surface was mirror-still, reflecting the mountains and clouds with perfect clarity.

"Subhanallah," Aunt Fareeda breathed.

Even through her headache, Ayesha had to admit it was breathtaking. The lake looked like something from a fairy tale—which, she supposed, it was. The legend of Prince Saif-ul-Malook and the fairy princess Badri-ul-Jamala was famous throughout Pakistan. This lake was where their love story had supposedly unfolded.

The jeeps parked in the designated area, a flat expanse of dirt where dozens of other vehicles sat—more jeeps, a few adventurous cars, even some motorcycles. Tourists milled about, bundled in jackets despite it being summer. The altitude made everything colder.

"Okay, everyone out!" Uncle Jamil announced. "We have two hours here. Take photos, enjoy the lake, but stay together. And nobody goes in the water—it's glacial, you'll freeze."

They disembarked, and immediately Ayesha felt the difference in the air. Thinner, colder, crisp in a way that made her lungs work harder. At over 10,500 feet, every movement took effort.

Around her, the family felt it too. The male cousins moved slowly, breathing deliberately. Aunt Sadia sat on a nearby rock almost immediately, waving off offers of help. The younger kids were energetic at first, but their movements were sluggish, uncoordinated.

"Take it easy," Uncle Tariq warned. "The altitude can make you dizzy."

And then there was Areeba.

She strode toward the lake like she was taking a walk in the park. Long steps, arms swinging, breathing normally. When she reached the rocky shore, she bent down and picked up a flat stone, examining it with interest.

"Come on!" she called back. "Let's walk around the lake!"

"Walk around it?" Aunt Fareeda looked horrified. "Beta, it's enormous! And we're all tired!"

"You guys are tired? Already?" Areeba shook her head, looking genuinely confused. "But we just got here!"

Ayesha trudged toward her cousin, each step requiring conscious effort. The headache pounded behind her eyes, and she felt vaguely nauseous. When she finally reached Areeba, she had to stop and catch her breath.

"You're not... tired?" Ayesha managed.

"No. Should I be?"

"Areeba, we're at over 10,000 feet. The air is literally thinner. Most people feel it."

Areeba looked at the mountains, then at the lake, then at Ayesha. Something like understanding crossed her face. "Oh. Right. The altitude thing. I forgot." She paused. "I mean, I don't feel it, but I guess I should?"

"You don't feel it," Ayesha repeated slowly.

"Is that weird?"

"Yes, Areeba. That's weird. You fainted three times yesterday from apparently nothing, and today you're running around at high altitude like it's nothing."

Areeba's expression clouded. That bright smile faltered. "I told you, I feel fine now. Better than fine. I feel..." She trailed off, searching for words. "Strong. Clear. Like I could do anything."

Before Ayesha could respond, Areeba suddenly bent down and in one smooth motion, scooped Ayesha up into her arms.

"What—HEY!" Ayesha yelped, grabbing onto Areeba's shoulders for balance. "Put me down!"

But Areeba was already walking, carrying Ayesha like she weighed nothing, heading toward a cluster of rocks near the lake's edge. She wasn't even breathing hard.

"See? I'm strong now!" Areeba said cheerfully. "I can carry you no problem!"

"AREEBA!"

"What's happening?" Aunt Fareeda's alarmed voice came from behind them.

"Why is Areeba carrying Ayesha?" Bilal asked, sounding equal parts confused and amused.

"Put her down!" Uncle Jamil's voice boomed. "What are you doing?"

Areeba finally set Ayesha down on a flat rock, carefully, almost gently. But Ayesha's heart was racing, and not from the sudden movement.

Because Areeba had just carried her. A grown woman. At over 10,000 feet elevation. Without breaking a sweat.

Without even breathing hard.

Areeba herself was a slender twenty-two-year-old who'd never worked out a day in her life. Who used to complain about carrying grocery bags from the car to the house.

This was impossible.

"How did you..." Ayesha stared at her cousin. "How did you just do that?"

Areeba looked down at her own arms, flexing them experimentally. "I don't know. I just... did. I wanted to show you I'm fine, so I picked you up. Was that wrong?"

"You carried a full-grown person like she was a bag of flour!" Faizan said, having jogged over with the others. He was breathing hard from the exertion. "How?"

"I guess I'm stronger than I thought?" Areeba offered, but she sounded uncertain now, like she was realizing her mistake.

Uncle Tariq's expression had gone serious. "Beta, that's not normal. Maybe we really should take you to a doctor."

"No!" Areeba's response was sharp, almost panicked. "No doctors. I'm fine. I just... I've been feeling really good today. Is that a crime?"

"It's not normal," Aunt Sadia said, her voice quiet but firm. "Nothing about your behavior today has been normal."

Areeba's jaw tightened. For a moment, that blank expression from the hotel staircase returned—empty, cold. Then she forced a smile. "I'm just excited to be here. That's all. I got carried away. Sorry."

But as the family slowly dispersed—some to take photos, others to rest, Uncle Jamil and Uncle Tariq talking in low, concerned voices—Ayesha stayed on her rock, watching Areeba.

Her cousin had wandered to the water's edge and stood there, staring out at the lake with an intensity that seemed wrong. Her lips were moving again, forming silent words. Her hands hung at her sides, fingers twitching.

And she wasn't shivering.

Everyone else was bundled in shawls and jackets, breath misting in the cold mountain air. But Areeba stood in just her thin kameez and that forgotten dupatta, completely unbothered by the temperature.

Like she didn't feel the cold.

Like she didn't feel anything.

Ayesha wrapped her arms around herself, suddenly chilled in a way that had nothing to do with altitude or weather. She thought about yesterday. About the fainting. About the way Areeba had examined her own hand like it was foreign to her.

About the way she'd woken up this morning—cheerful, energetic, wrong.

About the way she'd needed to be taught to braid her own hair.

About the way she greeted male cousins like a boy would.

About the way she'd just carried Ayesha without effort.

All the pieces were there, scattered like stones around the lake. Ayesha just couldn't—or didn't want to—put them together yet.

Because if she did, she'd have to accept something impossible.

Something terrifying.

That whoever—or whatever—was standing at the lake's edge, wearing her cousin's face and body...

Wasn't Areeba at all.
