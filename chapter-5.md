# CHAPTER 5: THE CONFRONTATION

The two hours at Saif-ul-Malook passed in a blur of photographs and forced normalcy. The family posed against the backdrop of impossible blue water and snow-capped peaks, smiling for cameras while Ayesha watched Areeba from the corner of her eye.

Her cousin remained unnaturally energetic, bounding from rock to rock, picking up stones and examining them with childlike fascination, asking questions about everything—"What kind of fish live here?" "Why is the water this color?" "What are those birds called?"—like a tourist in her own body.

Uncle Jamil checked his watch. "Okay, everyone! Time to head back. We want to reach Naran before dark."

A collective groan rose from the group. The thought of another hour-long jeep ride on those brutal roads made everyone's bodies ache preemptively. Aunt Sadia looked like she might cry. The male cousins moved with the stiff gait of people whose muscles had already staged a rebellion.

But Areeba practically skipped toward the parked jeeps.

"That was amazing! Can we come back tomorrow?" she called over her shoulder.

No one answered. They were too busy trudging after her, breaths misting in the thin air, legs heavy with exhaustion and altitude sickness.

Ayesha hung back, letting the others pass. Her headache had subsided to a dull throb, but her unease had only grown. She watched Areeba reach the jeeps and pause, looking around as if trying to remember which one she'd arrived in.

Like she didn't know.

The family began sorting themselves out, the same groups as before. Ayesha started toward the first jeep, where Aunt Fareeda was already climbing in, when she noticed something.

Areeba had stopped moving.

She stood beside the jeep, one hand on the door handle, her body suddenly rigid. And then—

She jerked.

A violent, full-body spasm, like she'd been shocked. Her head snapped to the side, her shoulders twisted, her free hand clawed at the air. For a brief, terrible moment, her face contorted—features pulling in different directions, expression cycling through confusion, fear, rage, and something else. Something pleading.

It lasted maybe two seconds.

Then Areeba's hand—the one clawing at air—came down hard across her own face.

The slap echoed across the parking area, sharp and vicious. Her head rocked to the side from the impact.

Ayesha froze, her breath catching.

Areeba stumbled, caught herself against the jeep, and when she straightened, her face was smooth again. Calm. That same bright smile sliding back into place like a mask being repositioned.

Ayesha's heart hammered against her ribs. She looked around—had anyone else seen that? But the family was occupied with settling into vehicles, arranging bags, helping the children. No one was looking at Areeba.

No one but Ayesha.

Their eyes met across the dusty parking area. For just a moment, Areeba's smile faltered. Her eyes widened—not with that false brightness, but with something real. Something terrified.

Then it was gone.

Ayesha's legs moved before her brain caught up. She crossed the distance between them in long strides, her exhaustion forgotten, her headache meaningless. Something had just happened. Something wrong. And she was done pretending she hadn't seen it.

"Ayesha!" Aunt Fareeda called from inside the jeep. "Come on, we're leaving!"

"One minute!" Ayesha called back, not taking her eyes off Areeba.

Her cousin watched her approach with an expression that was hard to read. Wariness? Fear? Curiosity?

When Ayesha was close enough, she didn't hesitate. She grabbed Areeba's shoulders and pushed her back against the jeep, hard enough that Areeba's back hit the metal with a dull thud. Hard enough to be serious.

"Hey—" Areeba started.

"I know," Ayesha said, her voice low and fierce. She kept her body positioned to block them from the others' view. "I know you're not Areeba."

The words hung in the cold mountain air.

Areeba's eyes went wide. For a heartbeat, two heartbeats, she just stared at Ayesha. And in that stare, Ayesha saw the mask crack. Saw something beneath it—something ancient and vast and utterly inhuman—looking back at her.

Then Areeba's face twisted.

Her mouth opened, trembling. Her eyes filled with tears—real tears, spilling down her cheeks. Her hands came up to grip Ayesha's arms, fingers digging in with desperate strength.

"Ayesha—" The voice was Areeba's. Exactly Areeba's. Shaking and frightened and confused. "Ayesha, what's happening to me?"

Ayesha's grip loosened. "Areeba?"

"I don't—I can't—" Areeba's whole body was trembling now. The tears came faster. "I keep losing time. I'll be doing something and then suddenly I'm somewhere else and I don't remember—I don't remember—" Her voice broke. "Help me. Please. Something's wrong. Something's inside—"

Her eyes cleared for just a moment. Focused. And in them, Ayesha saw her cousin. The real Areeba. Terrified and trapped and fighting.

"Oh my God," Ayesha breathed. "You're still in there—"

Areeba's hand shot up and slapped herself again.

The crack was loud. Violent. Areeba's head snapped to the side and when it came back, her expression had changed completely. The tears were still there, but the eyes were different. Cold. Calculating.

And then they filled with a different kind of tears—performative ones. The face crumpled in exaggerated distress.

"Why are you hurting me?" The voice was higher now, younger, victimized. Areeba's hands pushed weakly at Ayesha's chest. "Ayesha, please! You're scaring me! Why are you being like this?"

"No," Ayesha hissed. "No, I just saw—you just—"

"Please stop!" Areeba's voice rose, loud enough to carry. "You're hurting me!"

"I'm not—"

"AYESHA!" Aunt Fareeda's sharp voice cut through everything.

Ayesha's head whipped around. Her aunt had climbed out of the jeep and was striding toward them, her face a thundercloud of anger and concern. Uncle Tariq was looking over from the other jeep, his expression confused.

"What is going on here?" Aunt Fareeda demanded, reaching them in seconds. She grabbed Ayesha's arm and pulled her away from Areeba. "What are you doing?"

"I wasn't—she's not—" Ayesha struggled to find words that wouldn't sound insane.

Areeba had pressed herself back against the jeep, one hand to her reddened cheek—the one she'd slapped herself, Ayesha thought wildly—her eyes wide and brimming with tears. The picture of a victim.

"She just grabbed me," Areeba said, her voice small and hurt. "I don't know why. I was just standing here and she pushed me against the jeep and started saying weird things—"

"I did not—"

"Ayesha!" Aunt Fareeda's voice was sharp with disappointment. "She's your sister! What's gotten into you?"

Sister. They called each other that, even though they were cousins. In their culture, close cousins were sisters, brothers. Family.

"She's not—" Ayesha started, but how could she finish that sentence? She's not my sister? She's not herself? She's not human?

"I know she's been acting strange," Aunt Fareeda continued, her voice softening slightly, "and I know you're worried. We all are. But you can't just attack her—"

"I didn't attack her! I was trying to—" What? Help? Confront whatever was wearing her cousin's skin? "Something's wrong with her!"

"Yes, obviously something is wrong! She fainted three times yesterday! But manhandling her isn't going to help!"

Areeba sniffled, wiping at her eyes. When she lowered her hand, she was looking at Ayesha with an expression of such perfect hurt and confusion that for a moment, Ayesha doubted herself.

Had she imagined the jerking? The self-slapping? The moment when Areeba's eyes had been clear and terrified and real?

"I'm sorry," Areeba said softly. "I don't know what I did to upset you. I was just trying to have fun today. After yesterday, I thought..." She trailed off, lower lip trembling. "I thought you'd be happy I was feeling better."

The performance was perfect. Too perfect.

"Is everything okay?" Uncle Tariq had approached, his brow furrowed with concern. "We heard shouting."

"Everything's fine," Areeba said quickly, pushing off from the jeep. She even managed a weak smile. "We were just playing around. You know how we are." She looked at Ayesha, and for just a fraction of a second, something cruel flickered in her eyes. Something masculine. Something that enjoyed this. "Right, Ayesha? Just playing?"

The words were a challenge. A dare. Say otherwise. Tell them what you think you saw. See if they believe you.

Ayesha's jaw clenched. Her hands curled into fists at her sides. Every instinct screamed at her to tell them, to make them see—but what had she actually seen? Her cousin jerking, slapping herself, and now standing here with red cheeks that looked exactly like someone else had hit her.

He'd done it on purpose, she realized with cold clarity. Slapped Areeba's face hard enough to leave marks. To make it look like Ayesha had struck her.

There was no proof. Nothing concrete. Just Ayesha's word against the evidence of those red cheeks and Areeba's wounded expression.

"Right," Ayesha heard herself say, the word bitter in her mouth. "Just playing."

Aunt Fareeda didn't look convinced, but her eyes kept going to Areeba's reddened cheek. The doubt was clear on her face—doubt about Ayesha. "Well, play later. We need to leave. It'll be dark soon." She turned to Areeba, her expression softening with concern. "Are you okay, beta? Your cheek is very red. Does it hurt?"

Areeba touched it gingerly, wincing slightly. "I'm fine. It doesn't hurt much."

She didn't offer an explanation. Didn't need to. The implication hung in the air—Ayesha had done this. Ayesha had hurt her.

Uncle Tariq's expression had cooled when he looked at Ayesha. "Let's just get back to the hotel. Everyone's tired and on edge."

They loaded into the jeeps in uncomfortable silence. The same configuration as before—Ayesha and Areeba in the same vehicle, separated by mere inches of seat. But the space between them felt vast. Unbridgeable.

As the jeep started and began its descent down the mountain road, Ayesha stared out the window, her mind racing. She replayed the moment over and over. The jerking. The self-inflicted slap. The way Areeba's eyes had cleared and she'd begged for help before that thing took control again.

She's still in there, Ayesha thought. Trapped. Fighting. And now everyone thinks I'm the one hurting her.

"You okay?" Areeba's voice came from beside her, soft and concerned. But there was an undertone to it. Something mocking.

Ayesha didn't look at her. "Fine."

"You seem upset."

"I'm tired."

"Your aunt keeps looking back at us." A pause. "I think she's worried you might hurt me again."

Ayesha's hands clenched in her lap. He was enjoying this. Twisting the knife.

"I didn't hurt you," she said quietly, still not looking over.

"Didn't you?" The voice was still Areeba's, but the tone was wrong. Too confident. Too amused. "That's not what my face says. That's not what they all think."

Ayesha finally turned to look at her cousin. Areeba's expression was serene, almost peaceful. But her eyes—her eyes held something cold and calculating. Something that definitely wasn't female. The way he looked at her, assessed her, was too direct. Too aggressive.

"What are you?" Ayesha whispered.

Areeba smiled. Just slightly. Just enough. "Careful," he said, his voice barely audible under the jeep's engine noise. "You're already on thin ice. Keep asking questions like that and they'll think you've lost your mind."

Then Areeba turned away, looking out her own window, and the conversation was over.

The rest of the descent passed in tense silence. Ayesha noticed Aunt Fareeda glancing back at them several times, her expression troubled. Once, their eyes met, and Ayesha saw the question there—*Are you okay? What's going on with you?*

But how could she answer? How could she explain?

By the time they reached Naran Bazar, the sun was sinking behind the mountains, painting everything in shades of orange and purple. The temperature had dropped noticeably. Tourists crowded the streets, heading to restaurants for dinner, bundled in shawls and jackets.

The jeeps pulled up to Lalazar Hotel just as the streetlights flickered on. Everyone climbed out stiffly, groaning about sore backs and aching muscles. Even the children were subdued, worn out from the day.

"Dinner in one hour," Uncle Jamil announced. "Everyone freshen up. We'll eat downstairs in the restaurant."

They trudged into the hotel lobby. The same ceiling fans. The same smell of cooking meat and pine wood. The same creaky wooden stairs leading up to their rooms.

As they climbed—slowly this time, everyone exhausted—Ayesha stayed close to Areeba, but not too close. Aunt Fareeda had positioned herself between them, whether consciously or unconsciously, Ayesha wasn't sure.

When they reached the landing where Areeba had fainted yesterday, she paused and looked down at the floor.

"This is where it happened, right?" she asked. "Where I fainted the third time?"

"Yes," Aunt Fareeda said, her voice careful.

Areeba stared at the spot for a long moment. "I don't remember it at all." She looked up at them with such perfect, wounded innocence. "That must have been scary for you all. I'm sorry."

"Don't apologize, beta," Aunt Sadia said tiredly. "Just... try not to do it again."

"I'll try my best," Areeba said, and Ayesha heard the mockery underneath. The performance.

They continued to the second floor. The men split off to Room 7, the women to Room 9. Inside, everyone collapsed onto beds with grateful sighs.

"I'm never going anywhere that requires jeeps again," Aunt Sadia announced, pressing her hands to her lower back. "My spine has relocated to somewhere near my brain."

Aunt Fareeda hummed in agreement, kicking off her shoes. "I'm going to shower first if no one minds. I feel like I'm covered in dust."

"Go ahead," Aunt Sadia said, already pulling out her phone charger even though there was no signal.

As Aunt Fareeda gathered her things and disappeared into the bathroom, the room settled into quiet. Aunt Sadia closed her eyes, resting. The younger cousins had gone to the men's room to play with their brothers.

Which left Ayesha and Areeba.

Ayesha sat on her bed, pulling out a book from her bag, trying to look occupied. She could feel Areeba watching her from across the room.

Minutes passed. The sound of the shower ran in the background. Aunt Sadia's breathing had deepened—not quite asleep, but close.

"You're very quiet," Areeba said suddenly, her voice low.

Ayesha didn't look up from her book. "I'm reading."

"No, you're not. Your eyes haven't moved across the page once."

Ayesha's grip tightened on the book.

She heard movement—the creak of bedsprings, footsteps on the wooden floor. Then Areeba was standing beside her bed, looking down at her.

"We should talk," Areeba said quietly.

"There's nothing to talk about."

"I think there is." Areeba glanced at Aunt Sadia—still resting, eyes closed. Then she sat down on Ayesha's bed, close enough that their knees almost touched. "You're a problem."

Ayesha's eyes snapped up. Areeba's face was calm, almost friendly. But the eyes were all wrong. Hard. Male. Assessing.

"I don't know what you think you saw," he continued in Areeba's voice, "but you need to let it go."

"Give her back," Ayesha whispered fiercely. "Whatever you are, get out of her body."

Areeba smiled—a slow, cold smile that Areeba's face had never made before. "I don't think so. I'm quite comfortable here."

"She was fighting you. I saw her. She's still in there—"

"Oh, she is," he said, and there was something cruel in his tone. "Areeba is fine. She'll be back. In fact—" he tilted his head, as if listening to something internal, "—we're going to share this body. An arrangement, you might say. She gets some time, I get some time. Fair, don't you think?"

Ayesha felt ice spread through her chest. "That's not fair. That's not—this is her body. Her life."

"And now it's mine too." He leaned closer, and Ayesha instinctively leaned back. "Here's what's going to happen. You're going to keep your mouth shut. You're not going to tell anyone about our little... situation. Because if you do—" his smile widened, "—who do you think they'll believe? The girl who's been acting a bit strange after fainting, or the girl who attacked her cousin and left bruises on her face?"

"I didn't—"

"But that's what it looks like, isn't it?" He touched Areeba's reddened cheek. "Evidence. And if you start talking about possession or spirits or whatever explanation your little mind comes up with, well..." He shrugged. "They'll think you're crazy. Might even send you home early. Away from the family. Away from... Areeba."

The threat was clear. Speak up, and he'd make sure Ayesha was isolated, discredited, removed from the situation entirely.

"Why are you doing this?" Ayesha asked, hating how her voice shook. "Why her? Why any of this?"

"Why?" He seemed to consider the question. "Because I can. Because I was there, and she was... available. Because this—" he gestured at Areeba's body, "—is better than where I was." His expression darkened. "You have no idea what it's like. No form. No substance. No way to touch, to feel, to experience. And then she came along, walking right through the threshold, practically inviting me in."

"The bus," Ayesha breathed. "When she first fainted. That's when you—"

"Smart girl." He stood up, looking down at her with something like amusement. "So here's the deal. You keep quiet. You play along. You let me have my time in this body, and Areeba gets to share it. She'll come back sometimes. You might even get to talk to her. But if you interfere—" his voice dropped, took on a harder edge, "—I can make Areeba disappear completely. I can push her down so deep she'll never surface again. Do you understand?"

Ayesha stared at him, horror and rage warring in her chest. "You can't—"

"I can. And I will, if you force my hand." He straightened, and just like that, his expression shifted. Softened. Became Areeba's again—or a convincing imitation of it. "So be a good cousin. Keep your suspicions to yourself. And maybe, just maybe, we can all get through this trip without anyone getting hurt."

The bathroom door opened. Aunt Fareeda emerged in a cloud of steam, wrapped in a robe, toweling her hair.

"Bathroom's free," she announced. "Ayesha, why don't you go next?"

Ayesha couldn't move. Couldn't speak. She was still staring at Areeba, who smiled at her—bright and innocent and completely normal.

"Go ahead, Ayesha," Areeba said sweetly. "You look like you could use a cold shower."

The double meaning wasn't lost on anyone, but Aunt Fareeda just laughed. "The water's barely lukewarm as it is!"

Somehow, Ayesha stood. Somehow, she gathered her clothes with numb fingers and walked to the bathroom. She closed the door behind her and locked it, then leaned against the sink, her whole body trembling.

*Areeba is fine. She'll be back.*

But for how long? And what would happen to her while that thing was in control?

*Keep your mouth shut.*

Ayesha looked at her reflection in the small, fogged mirror. She looked pale. Frightened. Young.

But beneath the fear, something else was hardening. Determination.

He wanted her to stay quiet. To play along. To let him have Areeba without a fight.

But he'd made a mistake. He'd confirmed what Ayesha suspected. He'd admitted Areeba was still in there, still fighting, still alive in some way.

Which meant she could still be saved.

Ayesha turned on the shower, letting the sound of water mask any noise, and made her decision.

She would play along. She would pretend to go along with his demands. But she wouldn't stop. She'd watch. She'd wait. She'd find a way to communicate with Areeba when she surfaced. She'd figure out what this thing was and how to get it out.

She didn't know how yet. Didn't know if it was even possible.

But she had to try.

Because that thing wearing Areeba's face had made one thing clear: he was dangerous. He was in control. And he had no intention of leaving.

Unless someone made him.

And if no one else could see what Ayesha saw, if no one else would believe her, then she'd have to do it alone.

She showered quickly, the lukewarm water doing nothing to wash away her fear or her resolve. When she emerged, the room had settled into pre-dinner preparation. Aunt Fareeda was getting dressed behind the bathroom door. Aunt Sadia was fixing her hair. 

Areeba sat on her bed, scrolling through her phone—or pretending to, since there was no signal. When Ayesha entered, she looked up and smiled. A private smile. A knowing smile.

A smile that said: *I own this situation. I own you. I own her.*

Ayesha looked away first, hating herself for it, but knowing she had to choose her battles carefully.

Outside the window, night had fallen completely over Naran. The mountains loomed black against a sky full of stars—more stars than Ayesha had ever seen, so many they looked like someone had spilled salt across velvet.

Beautiful and cold and indifferent.

Just like the thing sitting across the room, wearing her cousin's face, waiting.

Always watching.

Always in control.

For now.
