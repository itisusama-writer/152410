# CHAPTER 5: THE CONFRONTATION

The two hours at Saif-ul-Malook passed in a blur of photographs and forced normalcy. The family posed against the backdrop of impossible blue water and snow-capped peaks, smiling for cameras while Ayesha watched Areeba from the corner of her eye.

Her cousin remained unnaturally energetic, bounding from rock to rock, picking up stones and examining them with childlike fascination, asking questions about everything—"What kind of fish live here?" "Why is the water this color?" "What are those birds called?"—like a tourist in her own body.

Uncle Jamil checked his watch. "Okay, everyone! Time to head back. We want to reach Naran before dark."

A collective groan rose from the group. The thought of another hour-long jeep ride on those brutal roads made everyone's bodies ache preemptively. Aunt Sadia looked like she might cry. The male cousins moved with the stiff gait of people whose muscles had already staged a rebellion.

But Areeba practically skipped toward the parked jeeps.

"That was amazing! Can we come back tomorrow?" she called over her shoulder.

No one answered. They were too busy trudging after her, breaths misting in the thin air, legs heavy with exhaustion and altitude sickness.

Ayesha hung back, letting the others pass. Her headache had subsided to a dull throb, but her unease had only grown. She watched Areeba reach the jeeps and pause, looking around as if trying to remember which one she'd arrived in.

Like she didn't know.

The family began sorting themselves out, the same groups as before. Ayesha started toward the first jeep, where Aunt Fareeda was already climbing in, when she noticed something.

Areeba had stopped moving.

She stood beside the jeep, one hand on the door handle, her body suddenly rigid. And then—

She jerked.

A violent, full-body spasm, like she'd been shocked. Her head snapped to the side, her shoulders twisted, her free hand clawed at the air. For a brief, terrible moment, her face contorted—features pulling in different directions, expression cycling through confusion, fear, rage, and something else. Something pleading.

It lasted maybe two seconds.

Then Areeba's hand—the one clawing at air—came down hard across her own face.

The slap echoed across the parking area, sharp and vicious. Her head rocked to the side from the impact.

Ayesha froze, her breath catching.

Areeba stumbled, caught herself against the jeep, and when she straightened, her face was smooth again. Calm. That same bright smile sliding back into place like a mask being repositioned.

Ayesha's heart hammered against her ribs. She looked around—had anyone else seen that? But the family was occupied with settling into vehicles, arranging bags, helping the children. No one was looking at Areeba.

No one but Ayesha.

Their eyes met across the dusty parking area. For just a moment, Areeba's smile faltered. Her eyes widened—not with that false brightness, but with something real. Something terrified.

Then it was gone.

Ayesha's legs moved before her brain caught up. She crossed the distance between them in long strides, her exhaustion forgotten, her headache meaningless. Something had just happened. Something wrong. And she was done pretending she hadn't seen it.

"Ayesha!" Aunt Fareeda called from inside the jeep. "Come on, we're leaving!"

"One minute!" Ayesha called back, not taking her eyes off Areeba.

Her cousin watched her approach with an expression that was hard to read. Wariness? Fear? Curiosity?

When Ayesha was close enough, she didn't hesitate. She grabbed Areeba's shoulders and pushed her back against the jeep, hard enough that Areeba's back hit the metal with a dull thud. Hard enough to be serious.

"Hey—" Areeba started.

"I know," Ayesha said, her voice low and fierce. She kept her body positioned to block them from the others' view. "I know you're not Areeba."

The words hung in the cold mountain air.

Areeba's eyes went wide. For a heartbeat, two heartbeats, she just stared at Ayesha. And in that stare, Ayesha saw the mask crack. Saw something beneath it—something ancient and vast and utterly inhuman—looking back at her.

Then Areeba's face twisted.

Her mouth opened, trembling. Her eyes filled with tears—real tears, spilling down her cheeks. Her hands came up to grip Ayesha's arms, fingers digging in with desperate strength.

"Ayesha—" The voice was Areeba's. Exactly Areeba's. Shaking and frightened and confused. "Ayesha, what's happening to me?"

Ayesha's grip loosened. "Areeba?"

"I don't—I can't—" Areeba's whole body was trembling now. The tears came faster. "I keep losing time. I'll be doing something and then suddenly I'm somewhere else and I don't remember—I don't remember—" Her voice broke. "Help me. Please. Something's wrong. Something's inside—"

Her eyes cleared for just a moment. Focused. And in them, Ayesha saw her cousin. The real Areeba. Terrified and trapped and fighting.

"Oh my God," Ayesha breathed. "You're still in there—"

Areeba's hand shot up and slapped herself again.

The crack was loud. Violent. Areeba's head snapped to the side and when it came back, her expression had changed completely. The tears were still there, but the eyes were different. Cold. Calculating.

And then they filled with a different kind of tears—performative ones. The face crumpled in exaggerated distress.

"Why are you hurting me?" The voice was higher now, younger, victimized. Areeba's hands pushed weakly at Ayesha's chest. "Ayesha, please! You're scaring me! Why are you being like this?"

"No," Ayesha hissed. "No, I just saw—you just—"

"Please stop!" Areeba's voice rose, loud enough to carry. "You're hurting me!"

"I'm not—"

"AYESHA!" Aunt Fareeda's sharp voice cut through everything.

Ayesha's head whipped around. Her aunt had climbed out of the jeep and was striding toward them, her face a thundercloud of anger and concern. Uncle Tariq was looking over from the other jeep, his expression confused.

"What is going on here?" Aunt Fareeda demanded, reaching them in seconds. She grabbed Ayesha's arm and pulled her away from Areeba. "What are you doing?"

"I wasn't—she's not—" Ayesha struggled to find words that wouldn't sound insane.

Areeba had pressed herself back against the jeep, one hand to her reddened cheek—the one she'd slapped herself, Ayesha thought wildly—her eyes wide and brimming with tears. The picture of a victim.

"She just grabbed me," Areeba said, her voice small and hurt. "I don't know why. I was just standing here and she pushed me against the jeep and started saying weird things—"

"I did not—"

"Ayesha!" Aunt Fareeda's voice was sharp with disappointment. "She's your sister! What's gotten into you?"

Sister. They called each other that, even though they were cousins. In their culture, close cousins were sisters, brothers. Family.

"She's not—" Ayesha started, but how could she finish that sentence? She's not my sister? She's not herself? She's not human?

"I know she's been acting strange," Aunt Fareeda continued, her voice softening slightly, "and I know you're worried. We all are. But you can't just attack her—"

"I didn't attack her! I was trying to—" What? Help? Confront whatever was wearing her cousin's skin? "Something's wrong with her!"

"Yes, obviously something is wrong! She fainted three times yesterday! But manhandling her isn't going to help!"

Areeba sniffled, wiping at her eyes. When she lowered her hand, she was looking at Ayesha with an expression of such perfect hurt and confusion that for a moment, Ayesha doubted herself.

Had she imagined the jerking? The self-slapping? The moment when Areeba's eyes had been clear and terrified and real?

"I'm sorry," Areeba said softly. "I don't know what I did to upset you. I was just trying to have fun today. After yesterday, I thought..." She trailed off, lower lip trembling. "I thought you'd be happy I was feeling better."

The performance was perfect. Too perfect.

"Is everything okay?" Uncle Tariq had approached, his brow furrowed with concern. "We heard shouting."

"Everything's fine," Areeba said quickly, pushing off from the jeep. She even managed a weak smile. "We were just playing around. You know how we are." She looked at Ayesha, and for just a fraction of a second, something cruel flickered in her eyes. "Right, Ayesha? Just playing?"

The words were a challenge. A dare. Say otherwise. Tell them what you think you saw. See if they believe you.

Ayesha's jaw clenched. Her hands curled into fists at her sides. Every instinct screamed at her to tell them, to make them see—but what had she actually seen? A jerking movement that could have been a muscle spasm. A slap that could have been... what? Swatting at an insect?

And her cousin's brief moment of clarity? That could have been anything. Confusion. Disorientation. The altitude affecting her brain.

There was no proof. Nothing concrete. Just Ayesha's gut feeling and a series of strange behaviors that could all be explained away by yesterday's fainting spells and possible head trauma.

"Right," Ayesha heard herself say, the word bitter in her mouth. "Just playing."

Aunt Fareeda didn't look convinced, but she nodded. "Well, play later. We need to leave. It'll be dark soon." She turned to Areeba, her expression softening. "Are you okay, beta? Your cheek is very red."

Areeba touched it gingerly. "I'm fine. I think a bug bit me earlier."

A bug. Of course.

They loaded into the jeeps. The same configuration as before—Ayesha and Areeba in the same vehicle, separated by mere inches of seat. But the space between them felt vast. Unbridgeable.

As the jeep started and began its descent down the mountain road, Ayesha stared out the window, her mind racing. She replayed the moment over and over. The jerking. The slap. The way Areeba's eyes had cleared and she'd begged for help.

She's still in there, Ayesha thought. Trapped. Fighting.

But what was she fighting against?

"You okay?" Areeba's voice came from beside her, soft and concerned.

Ayesha didn't look at her. "Fine."

"You seem upset."

"I'm tired."

A pause. Then: "I really am sorry if I scared you. I know I've been acting weird." The voice was gentle, reasonable. "I think yesterday messed me up more than I realized. But I promise, I'm still me."

Ayesha finally turned to look at her cousin. Areeba's expression was open, sincere, concerned. Everything it should be.

"Are you?" Ayesha asked quietly.

Areeba's smile didn't waver. "Of course. Who else would I be?"

The question hung between them as the jeep bounced down the mountain road, carrying them away from the fairy-tale lake and back toward Naran. Back toward the hotel where this had all started.

Ayesha noticed small things during the descent. The way Areeba still didn't brace herself during the violent jolts that had everyone else gripping their seats. The way she didn't seem affected when they passed through a section of road with a sheer drop on one side—a drop that made Aunt Sadia close her eyes and pray.

The way she sat perfectly still for minutes at a time, barely blinking, like a doll someone had positioned and forgotten.

And once, when she thought no one was looking, the way her lips moved in those same silent words. Her fingers twitched against her thigh in a pattern—tap tap, pause, tap tap tap, pause—like she was counting something. Or communicating.

But with who? Or what?

By the time they reached Naran Bazar, the sun was sinking behind the mountains, painting everything in shades of orange and purple. The temperature had dropped noticeably. Tourists crowded the streets, heading to restaurants for dinner, bundled in shawls and jackets.

The jeeps pulled up to Lalazar Hotel just as the streetlights flickered on. Everyone climbed out stiffly, groaning about sore backs and aching muscles. Even the children were subdued, worn out from the day.

"Dinner in one hour," Uncle Jamil announced. "Everyone freshen up. We'll eat downstairs in the restaurant."

They trudged into the hotel lobby. The same ceiling fans. The same smell of cooking meat and pine wood. The same creaky wooden stairs leading up to their rooms.

As they climbed—slowly this time, everyone exhausted—Ayesha stayed close to Areeba. Watching. Waiting for another slip. Another moment of wrongness.

But Areeba climbed the stairs normally. Carefully, even, her hand on the railing. When they reached the landing where she'd fainted yesterday, she paused and looked down at the floor.

"This is where it happened, right?" she asked. "Where I fainted the third time?"

"Yes," Aunt Fareeda said.

Areeba stared at the spot for a long moment. "I don't remember it at all." She looked up at them. "That must have been scary for you all. I'm sorry."

"Don't apologize, beta," Aunt Sadia said tiredly. "Just... try not to do it again."

"I'll try."

They continued to the second floor. The men split off to Room 7, the women to Room 9. Inside, everyone collapsed onto beds with grateful sighs.

"I'm never going anywhere that requires jeeps again," Aunt Sadia announced, pressing her hands to her lower back. "My spine has relocated to somewhere near my brain."

Despite everything, Ayesha felt a weak smile tug at her lips. Around her, the women settled into the comfortable rhythm of family—complaining about sore muscles, debating whether they had time for showers, discussing what to order for dinner.

Normal. It all seemed so normal.

Except for Areeba.

She sat on her bed, hands folded in her lap, watching everyone with that same intense attention. Learning. Cataloging. When Aunt Fareeda made a joke about Uncle Jamil's driving commentary, everyone laughed—and a half-second later, Areeba laughed too. Like she'd had to remember that jokes required laughter.

Ayesha caught her eye across the room. For a moment, they just stared at each other.

Then Areeba smiled. Slow and deliberate.

And Ayesha knew, with bone-deep certainty, that whatever was behind that smile was not her cousin.

But how could she prove it? How could she make anyone believe her when she barely believed it herself?

The entity—because that's what it was, Ayesha was sure now, some kind of entity—had been perfect downstairs. Victimized and vulnerable in all the right ways. It knew how to play them. How to use their love for Areeba against them.

"Ayesha?" Aunt Fareeda's voice broke through her thoughts. "Are you alright? You've been very quiet."

"Just tired," Ayesha said automatically.

"Why don't you shower first? It might help you feel better."

Ayesha nodded and gathered her things, grateful for an excuse to escape those watching eyes. In the bathroom, she locked the door and leaned against it, finally allowing herself to shake.

What was she supposed to do? Who would believe her? She could barely articulate what she suspected without sounding insane.

She turned on the shower, letting the sound of running water cover any noise, and pulled out her phone. Still no signal. Of course not.

Even if she had signal, who would she call? What would she say? "Hello, I think my cousin has been possessed by something"? They'd think she was crazy. Hell, she thought she was crazy.

But she'd seen Areeba's eyes clear. Heard her beg for help. Watched her slap herself to regain control.

Something had taken over her cousin's body. And the real Areeba was still in there, trapped, fighting.

Ayesha splashed cold water on her face, staring at her reflection in the small mirror. She looked exhausted. Scared.

"Think," she whispered to herself. "Think."

She needed proof. Something concrete. Something undeniable.

And she needed to figure out what this thing was, and how to get it out of Areeba before...

Before what?

Before it was too late. Before Areeba stopped fighting. Before whatever was wearing her skin decided it didn't need to pretend anymore.

Ayesha straightened, setting her jaw. Fine. If no one would believe her, she'd have to handle this herself. Watch. Document. Gather evidence.

And find a way to save her cousin.

Even if it meant confronting something impossible. Something that shouldn't exist.

She showered quickly, the lukewarm water doing nothing to wash away her fear. When she emerged, wrapped in a towel with her hair dripping, she found the room in semi-darkness. Aunt Fareeda had drawn the curtains and turned on only one small lamp.

Areeba sat on her bed, silhouetted against the window, her head tilted at an odd angle. Listening to something only she could hear.

Or maybe not listening.

Maybe communicating.

Ayesha clutched her towel tighter and made a silent promise. She would figure this out. She would find a way to help Areeba.

Even if it killed her.

Outside the window, night had fallen completely over Naran. The mountains loomed black against a sky full of stars—more stars than Ayesha had ever seen, so many they looked like someone had spilled salt across velvet.

Beautiful and cold and indifferent.

Just like whatever was sitting on her cousin's bed, wearing her cousin's face, waiting.

Always watching.

Always waiting.
