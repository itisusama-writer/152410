# CHAPTER 2: LALAZAR

Aunt Fareeda's scream shattered the mountain stillness.

"AREEBA!"

Ayesha's bag hit the ground as she lunged forward, dropping to her knees beside her sister's crumpled form. The concrete was rough and cold through her shalwar, tiny pebbles digging into her skin. Areeba lay motionless, her dupatta twisted around her neck, one arm bent beneath her at an angle that made Ayesha's stomach lurch.

"Not again!" Aunt Sadia's voice pitched high with panic. "Ya Allah, not again!"

"Get water! Someone get water!" Aunt Fareeda was already kneeling, her hands hovering over Areeba's face, shaking so badly she couldn't seem to touch her.

The other female cousins crowded around, creating a wall of bodies. Their shadows fell across Areeba's pale face, and somewhere beyond the circle, Ayesha could hear the children's laughter cutting off abruptly as word spread.

"What's happening?" Uncle Jamil's voice boomed across the gas station. Heavy footsteps thundered toward them. "Move! Let me through!"

Ayesha pressed her fingers against Areeba's wrist, searching for a pulse. Her own heart was hammering so hard she couldn't tell if the flutter she felt was Areeba's or her own blood rushing through her fingers.

"Is she breathing?" Aunt Fareeda demanded.

"I... I think so." Ayesha leaned closer. Yes. Shallow, but there. Areeba's chest rose and fell almost imperceptibly.

Uncle Jamil burst through the circle, Uncle Tariq right behind him. "What happened? Did she hit her head?"

"She just fell!" Ayesha said. "Just like before, she just... collapsed."

"This isn't normal," Uncle Tariq muttered, his face grim. "This isn't dehydration or car sickness. Something's wrong."

Water materialized, a bottle thrust into the circle by one of the male cousins. Aunt Fareeda grabbed it with trembling hands, twisting off the cap so frantically that water sloshed over the rim, splashing onto the concrete and darkening it in spreading splotches.

"Areeba! Beta, wake up!" She sprinkled water across Areeba's face. Droplets caught in her eyelashes, rolled down her temples. "Wake up!"

Nothing.

Ayesha's throat tightened. On the bus, Areeba had come around quickly. This was taking too long. Her sister's face had that same awful grayish tint, lips bloodless and slightly parted. One of her sandals had come off in the fall, and Ayesha found herself staring at it, lying there a few feet away, abandoned and pathetic.

"Areeba!" Uncle Jamil patted her cheek, gentle at first, then firmer. "Come on, beta. Open your eyes."

More water. Aunt Sadia was reciting prayers under her breath, the Arabic words tumbling out rapid-fire. Someone else had started crying, one of the younger cousins, probably.

Then...

A gasp.

Areeba's eyes flew open, wide and startled, her whole body jerking as if she'd been shocked. She sucked in air like she'd been drowning, her hands clawing at the concrete.

"She's awake! Alhamdulillah!" Aunt Fareeda clutched her chest.

Areeba blinked rapidly, her gaze unfocused and wild, darting from face to face without recognition. For a terrible moment, Ayesha thought she wasn't going to come back this time, that whoever was looking out through Areeba's eyes wasn't her sister at all.

But then Areeba's expression shifted, clarity filtering back in stages. "What... what happened?"

The relief was palpable. Uncle Jamil helped her sit up slowly, one hand supporting her back. "You fainted again, beta. Same as before."

"Again?" Areeba's voice was small, confused. Her hand went to her head, fingers trembling. "I don't... I don't remember..."

"That's it," Uncle Tariq said firmly. "We're taking you to a hospital. There must be one in Naran"

"No!" Areeba's response was sharp, immediate. "No, please. I'm fine. I just, maybe I stood up too fast. The altitude"

"Don't be stupid," Aunt Sadia snapped, fear making her harsh. "You can't keep fainting like this! What if something's seriously wrong?"

"Nothing's wrong!" Areeba tried to stand, wobbled, and Uncle Jamil caught her elbow. "I feel fine now. Really. Please, I don't want to ruin the trip for everyone."

Ayesha studied her sister's face. The color was returning, yes, but there was something else, a tightness around her eyes, a forced quality to her smile. Like she was performing normalcy rather than feeling it.

"We should at least rest," Uncle Jamil said. "How much farther to the hotel, driver?"

The bus driver had joined the crowd, his leathery face creased with concern. "Thirty minutes, sahib. Maybe forty with these roads."

"Then let's get her on the bus and go. She can lie down once we reach Lalazar."

They helped Areeba up, a forest of supporting hands. She moved gingerly, testing each step. Ayesha retrieved the fallen sandal and her own abandoned bag, her mind spinning. Twice in less than an hour. What were the odds of that being coincidence?

As they guided Areeba back to the bus, Ayesha caught her sister's eye. Areeba looked away quickly, but not before Ayesha saw it, a flicker of something that might have been fear.

---

The last leg of the journey passed in tense silence. The earlier excitement had evaporated, replaced by a watchful anxiety. Areeba sat wedged between Aunt Fareeda and the window, a human buffer against another collapse. Ayesha sat across the aisle, her eyes never leaving her sister for more than a few seconds.

Areeba stared out the window, her reflection ghostly against the passing mountains. She didn't speak. Didn't eat the biscuits Aunt Sadia offered. Just sat there, unnaturally still, while the bus climbed higher and higher into the Kaghan Valley.

The landscape transformed around them. The rocky hills gave way to proper mountains, their peaks sharp and snow-capped even in summer. Pine forests carpeted the slopes, dark and dense. The Kunhar River appeared beside the road, its glacial water a shocking turquoise against gray stone.

Beautiful. It should have been beautiful.

Instead, Ayesha felt a growing unease she couldn't name. Maybe it was the mountains themselves, too tall, too close, their shadows falling across the road like prison bars. Or maybe it was the way Areeba's lips were moving silently, forming words no one could hear.

When Ayesha blinked, her sister's lips were still. Had she imagined it?

Finally, the bus rounded a bend and Naran Bazar sprawled below them, a cluttered ribbon of hotels and shops wedged into the valley, the river rushing alongside it. Even in the off-season, the main bazaar buzzed with activity. Tour jeeps kicked up dust. Street vendors called out their wares. Tourists in colorful jackets browsed shops selling shawls and wooden crafts.

"There!" Uncle Jamil pointed. "Lalazar Hotel. See the sign?"

The bus navigated the narrow bazaar road with inches to spare, its horn blaring at pedestrians and donkeys alike. Lalazar Hotel stood three stories tall, its white paint chipped and faded but its sign freshly painted. A modest place, but clean, with window boxes full of marigolds and a small restaurant on the ground floor.

When the bus finally shuddered to a stop, the relief was universal.

"Alhamdulillah," Aunt Fareeda breathed.

They disembarked in a chaos of luggage and instructions. Uncle Jamil and Uncle Tariq handled check-in while everyone else milled about in the small lobby. The hotel smelled like pine wood and the lamb karahi cooking somewhere in the back. Ceiling fans spun lazily, barely disturbing the mountain air that drifted through open windows.

"Two rooms," Uncle Jamil announced, returning with keys. "Room 8 for the men, Room 9 for the ladies. Both on the second floor."

"No elevator?" Aunt Sadia eyed the narrow staircase dubiously.

"It's two floors, not twenty," Uncle Tariq said, already hefting a suitcase. "The exercise will do you good."

They divided the luggage. The men headed up first, their footsteps heavy on the wooden stairs. The women followed more slowly, burdened with bags and the day's accumulating exhaustion.

Ayesha climbed behind Areeba, ready to catch her if she stumbled. The staircase was dim, lit only by small windows at each landing. The wood creaked under their feet, and somewhere above, a door slammed.

Areeba climbed slowly, one hand on the railing, one hand clutching her small overnight bag. Her knuckles were white against the dark wood.

"Almost there," Aunt Fareeda encouraged from behind. "Just one more flight."

They reached the landing between floors. The window here looked out over the bazaar, late afternoon sun slanting through the glass. Areeba paused, silhouetted against the light.

"You okay, beta?" Aunt Sadia asked.

Areeba didn't answer. She swayed slightly, her bag slipping from her fingers.

"No..." Ayesha lunged forward.

But she was too late.

Areeba collapsed.

Not backward down the stairs, thank God, forward, onto the landing, her body hitting the wooden floor with a sickening thud. Her head bounced once, and then she was still.

"AREEBA!" Aunt Fareeda's scream echoed in the stairwell.

The men's footsteps thundered from above. Doors opened. Voices shouted. But Ayesha barely heard any of it. She was already on the ground, rolling Areeba onto her back, checking her airways, her pulse, her breathing.

Alive. Still alive.

"Not again, not again, not again." Aunt Sadia's mantra dissolved into sobs.

Uncle Jamil skidded onto the landing, nearly falling himself. "What... three times? THREE TIMES?"

"We need a doctor NOW!" Uncle Tariq was already pulling out his phone.

Ayesha cradled Areeba's head, protecting it from the hard floor. "Areeba, come on. Wake up. Please wake up."

Water appeared. They went through the ritual again, sprinkling, calling her name, patting her cheeks. But this time felt different. This time, Areeba's unconsciousness seemed deeper, more absolute. Her body was completely limp, boneless, and her skin had gone cold.

Too cold.

"She's freezing," Ayesha said. "Why is she so cold?"

Someone draped a shawl over Areeba. Someone else was crying. The hotel manager had appeared, wringing his hands and babbling about liability and doctors in the next valley.

"Wake up, beta, wake up, please wake up."

And then Areeba's eyes opened.

But something was wrong.

Ayesha knew it immediately, instinctively, in some primitive part of her brain that recognized predators and poison. Areeba's eyes were open, yes, but they were... empty. Not unfocused like before. Empty. Looking at nothing. Seeing nothing.

"Areeba?" Ayesha's voice came out as a whisper.

Areeba sat up.

The movement was wrong. Too smooth. Too controlled. Like a puppet on strings. No grogginess, no confusion, no gradual return to consciousness. One moment she was unconscious, the next she was upright, her spine straight, her head tilted at an odd angle.

"Beta?" Aunt Fareeda reached out hesitantly.

Areeba turned her head, too far, too fast, and looked at her aunt. But the expression on her face was completely blank. No recognition. No emotion. Nothing.

"Areeba, say something!" Uncle Jamil commanded.

Silence.

Areeba's mouth didn't move. She just sat there on the landing floor, surrounded by her panicked family, staring at them with eyes that held all the warmth of winter stones.

Ayesha's skin prickled. Every hair on her arms stood up. This wasn't her sister. This was something wearing her sister's face.

"Areeba?" Ayesha leaned closer, searching those empty eyes. "Can you hear me?"

Nothing. Not even a blink.

"She's in shock," Uncle Tariq said, but he didn't sound convinced. "Maybe she hit her head."

Areeba's hand moved.

Slowly, deliberately, she raised her right hand and stared at it, turning it this way and that, as if seeing a hand for the first time. Examining it. Learning it.

"What is she doing?" one of the younger cousins whimpered.

Ayesha's mouth had gone dry. She watched Areeba flex her fingers one by one, testing them, that same blank expression on her face. Then Areeba looked down at her own body, at her clothes, her legs, her feet, with that same detached curiosity.

Like someone trying on a new outfit.

Or a stranger inhabiting a borrowed body.

"This isn't right," Ayesha breathed. "Something's not..."

And then Areeba blinked.

Just once, but it broke the spell. Expression flooded back into her face, confusion, fear, disorientation. She looked around at the circle of frightened faces and her own eyes filled with tears.

"What..." Her voice cracked. "What happened? Why are you all." She noticed her raised hand, still suspended in the air, and lowered it quickly, staring at it like it had betrayed her. "Why am I on the floor?"

The relief was immediate but tentative. Aunt Fareeda pulled Areeba into a crushing embrace. "You fainted again, beta! You scared us to death!"

"I... I did?" Areeba's voice was small, confused. Normal. This was normal Areeba, frightened, disoriented, but herself. "I don't remember. I was climbing the stairs and then... nothing."

Ayesha studied her sister's face, looking for traces of that terrible emptiness. But Areeba's eyes were clear now, frightened but present. Had Ayesha imagined it? Had the stress and fear made her see things that weren't there?

But the cold feeling in her stomach remained.

"That's it," Uncle Jamil said firmly. "We're taking you to a doctor. Tonight. I don't care if we have to drive to Mansehra."

"No, please." Areeba tried to stand, wobbled, and three people grabbed her. "I'm okay now. Really. I just need to rest. Please don't make a fuss."

"A fuss?" Aunt Sadia's voice climbed an octave. "You've fainted three times! In one day! This isn't normal!"

"Maybe it's the altitude," the hotel manager offered weakly. "Some people react badly to the mountains. We have oxygen."

"She fainted in Lahore plains and on the highway before we even reached altitude," Uncle Tariq countered. "This is something else."

They argued over Areeba's head while Ayesha helped her sister to her feet. Areeba leaned heavily on her, legs shaking.

"Thanks," Areeba whispered.

"What happened?" Ayesha whispered back. "Just now, when you woke up. You weren't... you seemed..."

"I don't know what you're talking about." Areeba's voice was sharp, defensive. "I was unconscious and then I woke up. That's all."

"But you didn't say anything. You just sat there, staring."

"I was confused! I'd just fainted! What was I supposed to do, make jokes?" Areeba pulled away from her, swaying slightly but standing on her own. "Everyone needs to stop overreacting. I'm fine."

But her hands were shaking. And she wouldn't meet Ayesha's eyes.

Finally, a compromise was reached. Areeba would rest in the room. If she fainted again—even once—they were taking her to a hospital, trip be damned. Reluctantly, the family dispersed—the men to their room, the women continuing up the final flight of stairs with Areeba supported between them.

Room 9 was simple but clean—four single beds, white walls, thin curtains filtering mountain light. Areeba collapsed onto the nearest bed without even removing her shoes.

"Sleep, beta," Aunt Fareeda said, smoothing hair back from Areeba's forehead. "We'll be right here."

Areeba's eyes were already closing. Within minutes, her breathing had deepened into sleep.

Ayesha sat on the bed across from her, unable to look away. In sleep, Areeba looked peaceful. Young. Vulnerable.

Normal.

But Ayesha couldn't shake what she'd seen on the landing. That moment of absolute emptiness. The way Areeba had examined her own hand like it belonged to a stranger.

Like someone, or something had slipped into her skin.

Outside the window, the sun was setting behind the mountains, painting the peaks in shades of gold and blood. The Kunhar River rushed past below, its voice a constant whisper beneath the sounds of the bazaar.

Ayesha pulled out her phone. No signal, of course. The mountains blocked everything.

She looked at Areeba again, watched her chest rise and fall with each breath.

*What's happening to you?* she thought. *And why do I feel like this is only the beginning?*
