# CHAPTER 19: THE TRANSFER

Areeba lay on her bed, staring at the ceiling, feeling Faisal's presence like a warm weight in her mind.

*I should leave,* he said quietly. *This has become too complicated. Your parents are frightened, and rightfully so. I never meant to—*

"Just shut up." Areeba's voice was fierce. "You are mine and I am not going to leave you."

*Areeba—*

"I mean it. Stop talking about leaving. Stop being noble and self-sacrificing. I don't care if Mama and Baba are upset. I don't care if this is complicated. You're staying."

*You're being irrational.*

"I don't care about that either."

*You should. Your family is important. More important than—*

"Than what? Than you?" Areeba sat up, anger flashing through her. "You don't get to decide what's important to me."

*I'm trying to protect you.*

"By abandoning me? That's not protection, that's—"

A knock at the door interrupted her.

"Areeba?" Mama's voice. Tentative.

Areeba's jaw clenched. "I don't want to talk to you. And don't try to read anything to get him out."

The door opened anyway. Mama stepped inside, closing it behind her. She looked tired, worried, but not angry.

"I'm not taking him away from you," Mama said quietly.

Areeba stared at her, suspicious. "Then what do you want?"

"I was just asking..." Mama hesitated, then continued. "How does it feel? Having someone in your head?"

The question caught Areeba off-guard.

Before she could answer, Ayesha appeared in the doorway behind Mama, looking surprised. "You too, Mama?"

Mama glanced back at her. "What do you mean, 'you too'?"

"You want to know what it feels like. That's how it starts." Ayesha's voice held a note of bitter recognition. "Curiosity. Then before you know it..."

She trailed off, but the implication hung in the air.

Mama frowned. "I'm just trying to understand what you girls are experiencing."

"No," Ayesha said softly. "You want to experience it yourself."

For a moment, Mama looked like she might deny it. Then her shoulders sagged slightly.

"Is that so wrong? You're both describing something impossible. Something I can't comprehend from the outside. How can I make decisions about this situation if I don't understand what it actually is?"

Areeba studied her mother carefully. The request made sense on the surface. But underneath it, Areeba could sense something else.

The same hunger she'd seen in Ayesha's eyes. The same pull she herself felt every moment Faisal wasn't with her.

"It's not a party trick," Areeba said. "It's not something you just try out."

"I know that."

"Do you?" Ayesha asked, leaning against the doorframe. "Because once you feel it, you can't unfeel it. You can't go back to not knowing."

"I understand the risk."

"I don't think you do," Areeba said. But even as she said it, part of her was already considering the possibility.

If Mama experienced Faisal herself, maybe she would understand. Maybe she would stop seeing this as a problem to be solved and start seeing it as... what? A gift? A miracle?

*This is a terrible idea,* Faisal said in her mind.

*Why?*

*Because your mother is right to be concerned. This isn't normal or healthy. The more people who become attached to this, the worse it will get.*

*Or maybe,* Areeba thought back, *the more people who understand, the less alone we'll be.*

Faisal didn't respond to that.

Mama was still waiting, her expression a mixture of determination and uncertainty.

"Tell me," she said finally. "What does it feel like?"

Areeba took a breath. How could she possibly explain something so fundamental, so all-encompassing?

"It feels like..." She searched for words. "Like you've been half-asleep your whole life and suddenly you're awake. Like you've been speaking in whispers and someone finally taught you how to use your full voice."

She paused, then continued, the words spilling out faster now.

"It's like having a light on in a dark room. Constant companionship. Someone who knows everything about you and still chooses to stay. Someone who makes you better—smarter, stronger, more capable. You can think clearer because there are two minds working together instead of one struggling alone."

Areeba's voice softened. "It feels like you matter. Like someone sees you completely and finds you worth the effort. Worth staying for."

The room had gone very quiet.

Mama was staring at her daughter with an expression Areeba couldn't quite read. Sadness, maybe. Or recognition.

"You've been lonely," Mama said finally. "I didn't realize how lonely."

"I didn't either. Not until I wasn't anymore."

Behind Mama, Ayesha had gone very still. Her face was carefully blank, but Areeba could see the pain underneath.

Because Ayesha understood. She'd felt it too, during those few hours when Faisal had been hers.

Mama was quiet for a long moment. Then: "Can I meet him? Properly?"

Areeba's first instinct was to refuse. Faisal was hers. The idea of letting someone else have him, even temporarily, even her mother, made something possessive and sharp rise in her chest.

But Mama was asking. Not demanding, not threatening—asking.

And maybe if she understood...

"Okay," Areeba said quietly. "But you have to give him back."

"Of course."

"I mean it, Mama. I'm not—" Areeba's voice caught. "I can't lose him."

"I'll give him back," Mama promised. "I just want to understand."

Areeba nodded slowly, then looked at Ayesha. "You should probably stay. In case..."

In case of what? In case Mama panicked? In case something went wrong?

*In case she doesn't want to give him back,* Areeba's traitorous mind supplied.

But Ayesha nodded and stepped fully into the room, closing the door behind her.

The three of them sat on Areeba's bed—mother in the middle, daughters on either side. Like a ritual. Or a séance.

"How does this work?" Mama asked.

"Faisal has to want to transfer," Areeba explained. "And you have to be willing to receive him. It's a mutual thing."

*I don't think this is wise,* Faisal said again in her mind.

*Please,* Areeba thought back. *Trust me. If she understands, everything will be easier.*

*Or much more complicated.*

*Please.*

A pause. Then: *Because you asked. But only for a short time.*

*Thank you.*

Areeba turned to her mother. "He's agreed. Are you ready?"

Mama nodded, though she looked nervous. "What do I do?"

"Just... be open. Don't fight it. Let him in."

"That sounds ominous."

"It's not. I promise. It's—" Areeba struggled for words. "It's wonderful."

She took a breath, feeling Faisal gathering himself in her mind. The sensation of him preparing to leave was already painful—like a candle being pulled away from her hands, the warmth receding.

"Okay," Areeba whispered. "Go."

The transfer happened in a rush.

One moment Faisal was there, filling all the empty spaces in Areeba's mind. The next he was gone, and the absence was so sudden and complete that Areeba gasped.

Empty. Hollow. Alone.

The withdrawal slammed into her immediately—sharper than it had ever been, because she'd had no time to prepare. She'd been complete and whole one second, and fractured the next.

Beside her, Mama made a sound—half gasp, half cry.

"Oh," Mama breathed. "Oh my—"

Then her eyes went distant, unfocused, and Areeba knew Faisal was speaking to her.

"Hello, Faiza," Mama whispered, and Areeba realized it was Faisal's voice, Faisal's words, coming out of her mother's mouth.

Mama's face cycled through expressions—shock, overwhelm, wonder. Her hands came up to her temples, like she was trying to contain something too big for her skull.

"This is—I can't—there's so much—" Mama's words tumbled over each other. "How do you think with all this noise?"

"It's not noise once you get used to it," Areeba said, though her own voice sounded strange and distant to her ears. Everything felt distant without Faisal. Muffled. Wrong.

"He knows my name," Mama said, wonder in her voice. "My full name. My maiden name. He knows—" She stopped, eyes going wide. "He knows about the engineering degree I never finished."

Areeba blinked. "What engineering degree?"

"Before I had you girls, I was studying civil engineering. I dropped out in my third year when I got pregnant." Mama's voice was distant, attention turned inward. "I never told anyone I regretted it. Not even your Baba. But he knows. He understands why I—"

She trailed off, and for a long moment, just sat there, silent, having a conversation no one else could hear.

Areeba watched her mother's face transform. The stress lines smoothing out. The worried furrow between her brows relaxing. A small, wondering smile playing at the corners of her mouth.

The same expression Areeba saw in the mirror when Faisal was with her.

Complete. Connected. Whole.

And Areeba wanted to scream.

Because that was supposed to be hers. That feeling of completeness, that connection—it belonged to her. Faisal belonged to her.

Watching her mother experience it, watching that same wonder and joy bloom on Mama's face, felt like watching someone else wear your favorite piece of clothing. Like having something precious taken and given to someone else to play with.

*Give him back,* Areeba thought desperately, though of course no one could hear her now. *Please, give him back.*

On Mama's other side, Ayesha had gone rigid. She was staring at their mother with an expression Areeba recognized—the hollow-eyed look of withdrawal. Of desperate wanting.

"Mama," Areeba said, trying to keep her voice steady. "You said you just wanted to meet him."

"I know, beta, just—give me a moment. We're talking about load-bearing calculations and how they apply to—" Mama laughed, delighted. "This is incredible. I can see the numbers. I can understand the formulas I could never grasp in university. He's showing me how it all connects and it's so obvious now, why didn't I see it before?"

"Mama—"

"Wait, Areeba. He's explaining something about stress analysis."

"Mama, it's been long enough—"

"Just a few more minutes."

But Mama wasn't really listening. Her attention was turned completely inward, absorbed in whatever Faisal was teaching her, showing her, explaining to her.

Sharing with her.

The minutes stretched. Five. Ten. Fifteen.

And with each passing moment, the withdrawal got worse.

Areeba could feel it spreading through her like poison—the emptiness expanding, the silence in her mind growing unbearable. Her hands were shaking. Her chest felt tight. There wasn't enough air in the room.

Next to Mama, Ayesha was in similar distress. She'd wrapped her arms around herself, her breathing shallow and fast. A fine tremor running through her whole body.

They locked eyes across their mother. A moment of perfect, horrible understanding.

Both of them empty. Both of them desperate. And the thing they needed was with someone else.

"Faisal," Areeba said, her voice cracking. "Come back to me. Please."

Mama blinked, seeming to surface from whatever deep conversation she'd been having. "What? No, wait. We're not finished. He's explaining the history of structural engineering in the Indian subcontinent and—"

"I don't care!" Areeba's voice came out sharper than she intended. Desperate. "You said a few minutes. It's been twenty. Give him back."

"Don't be dramatic, Areeba. I'm just trying to understand—"

"Stop it, Mama. We are having... You can take him later."

Mama frowned. "That's not fair. You have him all the time. I'm just asking for a little while longer to—"

"No." Areeba stood up abruptly, the movement jerky and uncoordinated. "You promised. You said you'd give him back."

"And I will. When we're done talking."

"You're done talking now."

"Areeba—"

"Give him back!" Areeba's voice cracked into a sob. "Please, Mama, I can't—I need him. Please."

For the first time, Mama seemed to notice her daughter's distress. The shaking. The tears. The raw desperation in her voice.

"Beta, you need to calm down—"

"I can't calm down! You don't understand. It hurts. Being empty like this, it physically hurts."

Mama's expression shifted to concern. "It's been less than half an hour—"

"I don't care if it's been five minutes! I can't do this. I can't be without him."

"Areeba, you're being irrational—"

"Of course I'm being irrational! That's what withdrawal is!" Areeba was crying now, unable to hold it back. "Why do you think I've been so desperate to keep him? Why do you think I can't let him go? Because this—" She gestured at herself, at the shaking and tears and desperation. "This is what it feels like when he's not there. This is what I'm avoiding."

The room went silent except for Areeba's ragged breathing.

Mama stared at her daughter, and something like understanding—and horror—crossed her face.

"You're addicted," Mama whispered. "To this. To him."

"I don't care what you call it. I just need him back. Please."

Mama opened her mouth, then closed it. She looked troubled, conflicted.

And then Ayesha spoke up, her voice small and broken: "Mama, please. I know you're trying to understand, but we're both... we're not doing well. Can you give him back to Areeba?"

Mama looked at Ayesha, taking in her daughter's pale face, her trembling hands, the hollow look in her eyes.

"You too?" Mama asked quietly. "You feel it too, even when you don't have him?"

"I know what I'm missing," Ayesha said. "That's enough."

For a long moment, Mama just sat there, Faisal still present in her mind, her two daughters falling apart on either side of her.

Then, reluctantly, she nodded.

"Okay," she said quietly. "Okay, I'll... how do I send him back?"

"Just let go," Areeba said desperately. "Just—stop holding on to him and let him come home."

Mama closed her eyes. Her face went through several expressions—reluctance, resistance, and then something that looked almost like grief.

"He doesn't want to go," Mama said. "He's worried about all of us. About what this is doing to us."

"I don't care. Send him back anyway."

Another pause. Then Mama took a shaky breath.

"Okay, Faisal. Go back to Areeba. We'll... we'll talk later."

The transfer happened more slowly this time. Areeba could feel it building—like a tide coming in, warmth spreading back through the cold empty spaces in her mind.

And then Faisal was there, filling her up, making her whole again, and Areeba sobbed with relief.

*I'm sorry,* Faisal said quietly. *I'm so sorry. This shouldn't have happened.*

*It's okay,* Areeba thought back, even though it wasn't. *You're back. That's all that matters.*

She wrapped her arms around herself, feeling the shaking start to subside, the panic receding. Complete again. Safe again.

Across from her, Mama sat very still, her eyes wide and shocked.

"Oh my God," Mama whispered. "Oh my God."

Beside her, Ayesha hadn't moved. She was still curled in on herself, arms wrapped tight, her face turned away.

Still empty. Still aching.

And Areeba, now whole and settled, felt a stab of guilt for not even thinking about offering Faisal to her sister.

But the guilt wasn't enough to make her actually do it.

Because she needed him more. She needed him too much to let go again, even for Ayesha.

Mama was staring at her hands like they belonged to someone else. "That was..." She trailed off, then tried again. "When he left, I felt..."

"Empty," Areeba finished quietly. "Hollow. Wrong."

"Yes." Mama looked up at her daughters, her expression stricken. "And you feel like that all the time? Whenever he's not with you?"

"Not all the time," Areeba said. "It's worse right after he leaves. It fades to a dull ache after a while. But it never goes away completely."

"That's horrible."

"That's why I can't give him up."

Mama was quiet for a long moment. When she spoke again, her voice was shaken. "I understand now. What you meant when you said I couldn't make you let him go."

"Will you try anyway?" Areeba asked, fear sharp in her chest.

Mama looked at her older daughter—really looked at her. At the fear and desperation and fierce possessiveness in her eyes. At the way she held herself, like she was protecting something precious.

"No," Mama said finally. "No, I won't try to take him away from you."

Relief flooded through Areeba so intensely she felt dizzy.

"But," Mama continued, her voice firm, "we need to figure out what to do about this. All of us. Because this situation—" She gestured vaguely at the three of them. "This isn't sustainable."

"Why not?" Areeba asked defensively.

"Because you're dependent on something—someone—you can't control. Because your sister is suffering in silence. Because I just experienced something impossible and I don't know what it means or what consequences it might have." Mama rubbed her temples. "And because apparently whatever this is, it's compelling enough that even I, a grown woman who should know better, didn't want to let it go after twenty minutes."

She looked between her daughters. "That's terrifying, girls. You understand that, right? How terrifying that is?"

Areeba understood. In the abstract, anyway. But understanding didn't change anything. Didn't make her want or need Faisal any less.

"What do you suggest?" Ayesha asked quietly.

"I don't know yet. I need to think. To talk to your Baba." Mama stood up slowly, like she wasn't quite steady on her feet yet. "But no more secrets. And no more pretending this is normal or okay. Whatever this is, we deal with it as a family. Agreed?"

Areeba wanted to argue. Wanted to insist that this was her situation, her connection, her choice.

But Mama's face was set in that expression that meant arguing would be pointless.

"Agreed," Areeba said reluctantly.

"Ayesha?"

"Agreed," Ayesha whispered.

Mama nodded. "Okay. I'm going to go talk to your Baba. You two... get some rest. It's been a long night."

She left, closing the door quietly behind her.

In the silence that followed, Areeba and Ayesha sat on the bed, not looking at each other.

Finally, Ayesha spoke. "That was bad."

"Yeah."

"She's going to want to talk about solutions. About fixing this."

"I know."

"What are you going to do?"

Areeba wrapped her arms tighter around herself, feeling Faisal's steady presence in her mind like an anchor. "Whatever I have to. To keep him."

Ayesha finally looked at her, and there was something sad and resigned in her expression. "Even if it costs you everything else?"

Areeba wanted to say no. Wanted to say that of course she wouldn't sacrifice her family, her relationships, her entire life for this.

But the honest answer—the one she couldn't quite bring herself to speak aloud—was different.

Because yes, if she had to choose between Faisal and everything else, she would choose Faisal.

Every time.

And from the look on Ayesha's face, her sister already knew it.
