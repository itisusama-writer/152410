# CHAPTER 18: THE SLIP

The exam results came out on Tuesday, posted online in the student portal.

Ayesha checked hers in her bedroom, alone, her heart hammering as the page loaded.

Structural Analysis: 68%

Not great. Not what she could have gotten with Faisal's help. But a pass.

She sat back, releasing a breath she hadn't realized she was holding. Relief mixed with something more complicated—pride, maybe. Or vindication.

She'd done it herself. The grade was hers.

A knock on her door. "Did you check?" Areeba's voice was tentative.

"Yeah. I passed."

"Me too. 62 in Calculus."

The door opened slightly. Areeba peeked in, looking uncertain. "Are you... okay with your grade?"

"I'm fine."

"Because if you want to talk about—"

"I'm fine, Areeba."

It came out sharper than Ayesha intended. Areeba flinched and retreated, closing the door quietly.

Ayesha immediately felt guilty. But she couldn't explain that the sharpness wasn't about the grade. It was about everything else.

The withdrawal had started the moment Faisal left her outside the mathematics building on Thursday. By Friday, it was a constant ache. By Monday, Ayesha felt like she was walking around with a hole in her chest.

She'd experienced this before—the emptiness after their tutoring sessions. But this was worse. Because she'd had him for hours. Long enough to remember what it felt like to not be alone in her own head.

Long enough to miss it desperately.

And Areeba had him. Every moment. Every night. Every waking hour.

Ayesha could see it in the way her sister moved—more confident, more grounded. Complete in a way Ayesha would never be.

It wasn't fair.

But Ayesha had promised not to ask. Had promised to respect the boundary. So she locked herself in her room, threw herself into her remaining exams, and tried to survive the emptiness.

She passed them all. Not brilliantly, but honestly.

It should have felt better than it did.

---

On Wednesday evening, Mama announced they were going out to celebrate.

"Both my daughters, done with exams! This calls for a treat. We're getting ice cream."

"Mama, I'm twenty-one," Ayesha said. "Ice cream is a bit childish."

"Ice cream is never childish. Come on, we're going to Glacier. The fancy place downtown."

Areeba appeared in the doorway, looking uncertain. "All of us?"

"Yes, all of us. Your Baba is already in the car. Let's go."

Ayesha wanted to refuse. Wanted to stay in her room where she didn't have to watch Areeba being whole while she felt hollow.

But Mama was already herding them toward the door, and refusing would require explanations Ayesha couldn't give.

So she went.

---

Glacier was busy for a Wednesday night—families with young children, university students, couples on dates. The bright modern interior was all white tile and hanging plants, with a long glass counter displaying rows of colorful gelato.

"Girls, pick whatever you want," Baba said, pulling out his wallet. "This is a celebration."

They joined the queue. Ayesha stood slightly apart from her family, hands in her pockets, trying to muster enthusiasm she didn't feel.

Ahead of them, Areeba was studying the flavors through the glass, her brow furrowed in concentration.

Then she made a face.

"No, we're not getting that," Areeba muttered under her breath.

Ayesha glanced at her. Areeba wasn't looking at any of them.

*She's talking to him,* Ayesha realized. *To Faisal.*

"The pistachio looks good," Areeba said, louder now, to the family. But then, quieter: "I don't care if you think it's too sweet. It's my ice cream."

Mama was talking to Baba about whether they should get cups or cones. Neither parent was paying attention to Areeba's muttering.

But Ayesha was.

She watched as Areeba's expression shifted—annoyance, then amusement, then fond exasperation. A whole conversation playing out across her face, only half of it visible to the world.

The ache in Ayesha's chest intensified.

They reached the counter. The worker, a bored-looking teenager, waited with his scooper ready.

"I'll have the pistachio," Areeba said.

Then she paused. Frowned.

"No, I won't. Fine. One scoop of—" She huffed. "Actually, you know what? We're just having vanilla."

"Vanilla?" Mama looked surprised. "You never get vanilla. That's so boring."

"It's not boring, it's classic," Areeba argued, but she wasn't looking at Mama. Her gaze was unfocused, attention turned inward. "Stop it, Faisal. We are having vanilla."

The words were out before Areeba realized what she'd said.

The bored teenager looked confused. Baba was still deciding between chocolate and coffee. But Mama had gone very still.

"Wait." Mama's voice was quiet. Dangerous. "Who is this Faisal?"

Areeba's face went white. "I—nothing. Nobody."

"You just told somebody named Faisal that you're having vanilla ice cream. Somebody who apparently has an opinion about your ice cream choices."

"I didn't—I was just—"

"Who. Is. Faisal?"

Ayesha watched her sister panic, scrambling for an explanation that wouldn't sound insane.

*A boyfriend,* Ayesha thought wildly. *She could say he's a boyfriend who texted her. That would be easier to explain than—*

"I am not having vanilla," Ayesha heard herself say.

The words came out sharp and automatic. Irrational. Driven by days of withdrawal and jealousy and the sudden, desperate need to be part of this. To not be the empty one, the outsider who only watched while Areeba got everything.

"Give him to me."

Silence.

Four pairs of eyes turned to stare at Ayesha.

Her parents, confused and alarmed.

The teenager behind the counter, now thoroughly entertained.

And Areeba, looking absolutely horrified.

"What?" Mama's voice had gone dangerously soft.

Ayesha's brain caught up with her mouth. *Oh god. Oh no.*

"I meant—" she started, but there was no way to walk this back. No explanation that would make sense.

Mama looked between her daughters, her expression shifting from confusion to understanding to something harder.

"There is something you both are hiding," she said quietly. "Both of you. This Faisal—whoever he is—you both know him."

"Mama, it's not what you think—" Areeba started.

"I don't know what to think. But we are going to figure this out." Mama turned to the teenager. "Two vanillas, one pistachio, one coffee. Cups."

"Mama—"

"Not here." Mama's voice was iron. "Just finish your ice cream and we will have a discussion back at home."

---

The drive home was suffocating.

Ayesha sat in the back seat, her untouched vanilla ice cream melting in her lap, and tried not to throw up.

*What did I do? What did I just do?*

Next to her, Areeba was rigid with panic, staring straight ahead. She hadn't touched her ice cream either.

In the front seat, Mama and Baba were having a whispered conversation Ayesha couldn't hear. But she caught snatches:

"—both of them—"

"—a boy—"

"—hiding something serious—"

*They think Faisal is a boyfriend,* Ayesha thought. *They think we're both involved with some boy.*

That was bad. Very bad.

But not as bad as the truth.

*The truth is worse,* Ayesha realized. *Because the truth sounds like we've lost our minds.*

Beside her, Areeba's breathing had gone shallow and fast. Panic attack territory.

"Areeba," Ayesha whispered.

Her sister didn't respond.

"Areeba, breathe."

"I can't—" Areeba's voice was barely audible. "I can't do this. I can't tell them. They'll think I'm crazy."

"Then we don't tell them."

"How? How do we explain—"

"I don't know. But we'll figure it out."

*Will we?* The cynical part of Ayesha's brain asked. *How exactly do you explain shared possession by a dead professor?*

They pulled into the driveway. Baba turned off the engine.

Nobody moved.

"Inside," Mama said finally. "Living room. Now."

---

Ayesha had been in trouble before. Caught cheating on a math test in eighth grade. Coming home past curfew in her first year of university. Small rebellions, quickly punished and forgiven.

This felt different.

This felt like standing on the edge of a cliff, about to fall.

They sat on the couch—Ayesha and Areeba side by side, united in terror. Across from them, Mama and Baba occupied the armchairs like judges at a trial.

Mama had her arms crossed. Baba looked more confused than angry, but that wouldn't last once he understood the situation.

If they could even make him understand.

"Start talking," Mama said. "Who is Faisal?"

Silence.

Ayesha and Areeba exchanged glances. A whole conversation in a look:

*You tell them.*

*No, you.*

*This was your slip-up.*

*You made it worse!*

"We're waiting," Mama said, her patience clearly wearing thin.

Areeba took a shaky breath. "Faisal was... he was our structural analysis professor."

"Was?"

"He died. Three months ago."

Mama's expression softened slightly. "I'm sorry. That must have been difficult. But why were you arguing with him about ice cream flavors? And why did Ayesha tell you to 'give him' to her?"

Areeba looked desperately at Ayesha. Ayesha looked back, equally desperate.

*We can't tell them,* Ayesha thought. *We can't.*

But what else could they do? Lie? Make up some elaborate story about—what? A shared delusion? An inside joke?

Nothing would make sense except the truth.

And the truth was impossible.

"He's..." Areeba started, then stopped. Tried again. "We can still... talk to him."

Baba frowned. "What do you mean, talk to him?"

"I mean he's still here. Sort of. In my head."

The silence that followed was deafening.

Mama and Baba stared at Areeba. Then at Ayesha.

"Both of you?" Mama asked quietly.

"Not exactly," Ayesha said. "He can only be with one of us at a time. Usually Areeba. But sometimes... he transfers to me."

*This sounds insane,* Ayesha thought. *This sounds absolutely insane.*

But they'd started now. Might as well finish.

"He's been helping Areeba with her studies," Ayesha continued. "Teaching her. But she asked me to... to take him during exams. So she wouldn't cheat."

Mama's face had gone through several emotions and settled on something between concern and disbelief.

"You're telling me," she said slowly, "that you are being possessed by the ghost of your dead professor."

"It's not possession exactly—" Areeba started.

"What would you call it?"

"I don't know! But it's real. He's real."

"Areeba." Baba's voice was gentle. Worried. "Beta, have you been under a lot of stress lately? With your exams and—"

"I'm not imagining it!"

"Nobody said you're imagining it," Mama said carefully. "But sometimes when we're under pressure, our minds can create—"

"I can prove it," Areeba interrupted.

Ayesha turned to stare at her sister. "What?"

"I can prove he's real. He knows things I don't know. Things Ayesha doesn't know. He can tell us things we couldn't possibly have made up."

"Areeba, that's not—" Ayesha started, but Areeba was already continuing.

"Ask me something about structural engineering. Something specific. Something I wouldn't know."

Baba looked helplessly at Mama. "I don't know anything about structural engineering."

"Then ask about history. Literature. He was a professor for thirty years. He knows all kinds of things."

Mama closed her eyes, looking pained. "This is not how I thought this evening would go."

"Please," Areeba begged. "Just ask. You'll see."

A long pause.

Then Mama sighed. "Fine. What was the capital of the Mughal Empire in 1600?"

Silence. Areeba's face went distant, listening to something only she could hear.

"Agra," she said finally. "But the capital moved to Lahore for about fourteen years under Akbar, then back to Agra, and then to Shahjahanabad—Old Delhi—under Shah Jahan."

Mama blinked. "That's... actually correct."

"Because I'm not making this up!"

"You could have studied this. You take history electives."

"I take modern history! I don't know anything about the Mughal Empire!"

"Okay, okay." Mama held up her hands. "Let's say, for the sake of argument, that what you're saying is true. That somehow this professor is... in your head. Why? How did this happen?"

Areeba and Ayesha exchanged glances again.

"We don't know," Ayesha admitted. "It just started after he died. He appeared to Areeba first. Then she introduced him to me."

"Introduced. You make it sound like you brought home a boyfriend."

"It's not like that!"

"Then what is it like?" Mama demanded. "Because from where I'm sitting, you're telling me my daughters are sharing the ghost of their professor, arguing over who gets to have him in their head, and hiding this from us for months!"

"Three months," Areeba said quietly.

"THREE MONTHS?"

Baba put a hand on Mama's arm. "Let's stay calm."

"Our daughters are either experiencing a shared psychotic episode or are actually being haunted by a dead man, and you want me to stay calm?"

"I want us to think clearly." Baba turned to the girls. "If what you're saying is true—and I'm not saying I believe it yet—but if it's true, is this... Faisal... is he dangerous?"

"No!" Both sisters said it simultaneously.

"He's kind," Areeba added. "He just wants to help. To teach."

"And you, Ayesha?" Mama asked. "What do you want from this situation?"

The question caught Ayesha off-guard.

What did she want?

She wanted to not feel empty. She wanted to experience what Areeba had—that constant presence, that connection. She wanted to matter to someone the way Areeba mattered to Faisal.

But she couldn't say any of that.

"I'm just helping my sister," Ayesha said instead.

Mama's eyes narrowed. "By taking this ghost during exam periods."

"So Areeba doesn't cheat."

"And you don't cheat either?"

"I refused his help during my exam. Ask him—" Ayesha stopped. "Ask Areeba to ask him. He'll tell you."

Areeba's face went distant again. Then: "He says Ayesha was very stubborn about not accepting help. That she probably could have gotten a 100 but settled for a 68 because she wanted to pass honestly."

Mama looked between them, her expression unreadable.

"This is insane," she said finally. "This entire situation is completely insane."

"I know," Areeba whispered.

"But you're not making it up."

"We're not."

Another long silence.

Then Baba spoke. "So what do we do about this?"

"What can we do?" Mama asked. "How do you... evict a ghost?"

"You don't," Areeba said quickly, alarm flaring in her eyes. "You can't make him leave."

"Why not?"

"Because I don't want him to leave!"

The desperation in Areeba's voice made everyone pause.

Mama studied her older daughter carefully. "Areeba... are you... attached to this presence?"

"He's not a presence. He's a person."

"A dead person."

"That doesn't make him less real!"

"Areeba—"

"You don't understand. You don't know what it's like. Having someone who actually listens. Who cares about teaching me, helping me, being there when I'm struggling." Areeba's voice broke. "I need him. I can't lose him."

Ayesha felt her sister's panic like a physical thing. And underneath it, from somewhere deep in her own chest, an echo of that same desperate need.

*I need him too,* Ayesha thought. *Just as much. Maybe more.*

Mama and Baba were looking at Areeba with growing concern.

"Beta," Baba said gently, "that sounds like... you're becoming dependent on this entity."

"So what if I am?"

"That's not healthy."

"Why not? People depend on other people all the time!"

"But this isn't another person," Mama said. "This is something we don't understand. Something potentially dangerous."

"He's not dangerous!"

"You don't know that. You don't know what this is or what it could do to you long-term."

Areeba stood up abruptly. "I'm not getting rid of him. You can't make me."

"We're not trying to make you do anything," Baba said. "But we need to understand this situation better. Maybe talk to someone—"

"Who? A therapist? They'll just say I'm crazy."

"What about an imam?" Mama suggested. "Someone who understands spiritual matters."

"No!" Areeba's panic was escalating. "If you tell anyone about this, they'll try to exorcise him or—or lock me up somewhere. I'm not doing it. I'm not giving him up."

She turned and ran from the room. A moment later, they heard her bedroom door slam.

In the ringing silence that followed, Ayesha sat frozen on the couch.

Mama turned to her. "And you? How do you feel about all this?"

Ayesha chose her words carefully. "I think Areeba needs support. Not judgment."

"I'm not judging her. I'm worried about her."

"I know."

"Are you worried too?"

*Yes,* Ayesha thought. *But not about what you think.*

She was worried about Areeba's dependence, yes. But she was more worried about her own jealousy. About the fact that even now, even with everything falling apart, part of her was glad this had happened. Glad for the excuse to be included, acknowledged, part of this impossible situation.

What did that say about her?

"I'm worried," Ayesha said finally. "But I think trying to force this to end would be worse than letting it continue."

Mama closed her eyes. "I can't believe I'm hearing this."

"I know this is a lot—"

"A lot? Ayesha, this is impossible. This is..." Mama trailed off, shaking her head. "I don't even know what this is."

Baba stood up. "I think we all need some time to process. We're not making any decisions tonight."

"But—"

"No buts. Everyone gets some space. We'll talk more tomorrow, once we've all calmed down."

Mama looked like she wanted to argue, but finally nodded. "Fine. Tomorrow. But this conversation is not over."

She looked at Ayesha. "Go check on your sister."

Ayesha nodded and stood up, her legs shaky.

As she walked toward the stairs, she heard her parents start to whisper urgently to each other. Planning. Strategizing. Trying to figure out how to handle their daughters' impossible problem.

But Ayesha's focus was on Areeba.

On the crisis she'd helped create.

On the secret that was now spilling out into the open, with consequences none of them could predict.

She knocked on Areeba's door.

"Go away," Areeba's muffled voice came back.

"It's me."

A pause. Then: "Come in."

Ayesha opened the door to find her sister curled up on the bed, arms wrapped around herself, face blotchy from crying.

"This is a disaster," Areeba said.

"I know. I'm sorry. What I said at the ice cream place—"

"It's not your fault. I started it. I was the one who said his name out loud." Areeba wiped at her eyes. "God, I'm so stupid. I just—we were arguing about flavors and I forgot where I was. Forgot that other people could hear me."

Ayesha sat on the edge of the bed. "What do we do now?"

"I don't know. They're going to try to make him leave. I know they will."

"They can't make him do anything. Can they?"

Areeba looked uncertain. "I don't know how this works. What if they bring in an imam to do ruqyah? What if that actually forces him out?"

"Would that work?"

"I don't know!" Fresh tears spilled down Areeba's cheeks. "I can't lose him, Ayesha. I can't go back to being empty."

The words hit Ayesha hard. Because she knew exactly what Areeba meant.

Being empty. Being alone in your own head after experiencing connection.

It was unbearable.

"What does he say?" Ayesha asked. "About all this?"

Areeba's face went distant for a moment. Then: "He says he's sorry. That he never meant to cause problems for us. That if our parents think it's best, he'll try to leave."

Something sharp and painful twisted in Ayesha's chest. "He'd actually go?"

"He says he doesn't want to hurt us. That our family is more important than—" Areeba's voice broke. "But I don't want him to go."

Ayesha didn't either. The thought of Faisal just... disappearing. Going wherever ghosts went when they finally let go. Never speaking to either of them again.

The loss would be devastating.

*For Areeba,* Ayesha corrected herself quickly. *The loss would be devastating for Areeba.*

But the lie felt thin even in her own mind.

"Maybe it won't come to that," Ayesha said. "Maybe once Mama and Baba calm down, they'll realize this isn't actually hurting anyone."

"You think?"

"I don't know. But it's possible."

Areeba nodded, not looking convinced. "Can you... can you give me some time alone? With him?"

The request stung more than it should have.

"Yeah. Of course."

Ayesha stood to leave, then paused at the door. "Areeba? I really am sorry. For making things worse."

Her sister looked up, eyes red and exhausted. "I know. It's okay."

But it wasn't okay.

Nothing about this situation was okay.

And as Ayesha closed the door and walked back to her own empty room, she couldn't shake the feeling that they'd crossed a threshold tonight.

That things were going to change, whether they wanted them to or not.

And that the fragile arrangement they'd built—the shared secret, the careful transfers, the desperate attempts to maintain some kind of normalcy—was starting to crumble.

The only question was what would be left when it finally fell apart.
