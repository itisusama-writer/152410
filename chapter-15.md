# CHAPTER 15: DESPERATE MEASURES

Ayesha started finding excuses to be near Areeba.

It started small. Studying in the same room instead of her own. Sitting closer during family meals. Walking to university together even when their class schedules didn't align.

"Why are you being so clingy?" Areeba asked on Tuesday, when Ayesha suggested they work on their separate assignments together in the living room.

"I'm not being clingy. I just thought we could spend time together. Like we used to."

Areeba's expression was skeptical, but she didn't argue. She settled on one end of the sofa with her Urban Planning textbook while Ayesha took the other end with her laptop.

For a while, they worked in silence. But Ayesha wasn't really focused on her hydraulics calculations. She was watching Areeba from the corner of her eye, hoping for—what? A glimpse of that internal world she could no longer access?

She saw Areeba's lips curve slightly, her eyes brightening with amusement at something.

Faisal. He'd said something funny.

Ayesha's chest tightened with longing so intense it took her breath away.

"What?" Areeba asked, not looking up from her book.

"Nothing. Just thinking."

But it wasn't nothing. Ayesha was realizing that proximity didn't help. Being near Areeba didn't let her hear Faisal or feel his presence. It only made the absence more acute—being so close to what she wanted and unable to reach it.

Like standing outside a warm house in the cold, watching through the window.

---

By Thursday, Ayesha's desperation had reached a breaking point.

She'd barely slept all week. Couldn't concentrate in lectures. Could barely eat. Every thought circled back to the same obsessive loop: she needed to experience that connection again. Just once more. Just to remember what it felt like.

She knew it was irrational. Knew it was wrong. But knowing didn't stop the wanting.

That evening, she found Areeba in her room, reorganizing her bookshelf—a sure sign she was having an internal conversation and wanted her hands busy.

"Areeba, can we talk?"

"I'm kind of in the middle of something."

"Please. It's important."

Areeba sighed, setting down a stack of textbooks. "Fine. What?"

Ayesha closed the door behind her and took a breath. "I need to ask you something. And I need you to really consider it before you say no."

Suspicion immediately clouded Areeba's face. "If this is about Faisal—"

"Just hear me out," Ayesha interrupted. "I know you said no before. But I've been thinking about it all week, and I just—I need to experience it one more time. Just for a few minutes. Please."

"No."

"Areeba—"

"I said no. We already discussed this."

"But you don't understand—"

"I understand perfectly." Areeba's voice hardened. "You're addicted. From one night. Which is exactly why I'm not letting you have more."

Ayesha felt heat rise to her face. "I'm not addicted. I just want to understand better—"

"Don't lie to me. I can see it, Ayesha. The way you've been hovering around me. Watching me. You look like you're going through withdrawal."

The accuracy of the observation stung.

"So what if I am?" Ayesha's voice came out sharper than intended. "You have this incredible thing, this amazing experience, and you won't even let me—"

"Because it's MINE!" Areeba stood up, her eyes flashing. "Not yours. Mine. And I don't have to share it with you just because you want it."

"I'm your sister!"

"Which is exactly why you should respect my boundaries!"

They stared at each other, both breathing hard. Ayesha's mind raced, searching for an argument that would work. And then, in her desperation, a terrible idea formed.

"What if I told Mama and Baba?"

The words fell into the room like stones.

Areeba went very still. "What?"

"About Faisal. About what's really happening. I could tell them right now."

"You wouldn't." But uncertainty flickered across Areeba's face.

"Wouldn't I? You're taking a huge risk, Areeba. They deserve to know. And if you won't let me—"

"You're blackmailing me." Areeba's voice was flat with disbelief. "You're actually blackmailing me."

Shame burned through Ayesha's chest, but she pushed forward anyway. "I'm just saying, if you let me have a few minutes with him, I'll keep quiet. I'll help you manage this. But if you keep shutting me out—"

"GET OUT!"

The shout was loud enough to bring footsteps from downstairs.

"Girls?" Mama's voice drifted up. "Everything alright?"

Areeba was shaking—with rage, fear, or both. Her expression kept flickering as Faisal clearly tried to speak.

"We're fine, Mama!" she called back, her voice controlled despite the tremor in her hands. Then, quieter, to Ayesha: "You need to leave. Now."

"Just think about it—"

"I SAID GET OUT!"

Ayesha retreated to the hallway, her heart pounding. She'd done it now. Crossed a line she couldn't uncross.

But she couldn't bring herself to regret it.

She needed this. Needed him. Needed that feeling of wholeness again.

Even if it made her a terrible person.

Even if it destroyed her relationship with her sister.

She was that desperate.

---

An hour later, there was a knock on Ayesha's door.

She looked up from her bed, where she'd been lying in miserable silence, to see Areeba standing in the doorway. Her sister's face was pale, her jaw tight.

"Fine," Areeba said, the word clipped. "You win."

Ayesha sat up. "Really?"

"Five minutes. That's it. And I'm staying right there the whole time." Areeba's voice shook slightly. "And after this, we're done. You don't ask again. Ever."

"Areeba—"

"Those are my terms. Take them or leave them."

Ayesha knew she should apologize. Should take back the blackmail threat and try to repair the damage. But the need was too strong.

"Okay," she whispered. "Thank you."

Areeba's laugh was bitter. "Don't thank me. You threatened to destroy my life. This isn't generosity. It's survival."

She stepped into the room, and Ayesha noticed the way she was hugging herself, like she was trying to hold something in. Her expression kept shifting—internal argument clearly still raging.

"Faisal thinks this is a bad idea," Areeba said. "For the record. He thinks giving you what you want when you're acting like this will only make things worse."

"But he'll do it?"

Another flicker of expression—Faisal speaking. Areeba's face softened slightly, some of the anger melting into reluctant understanding.

"He'll do it because he feels guilty about causing problems between us," Areeba said quietly. "And because he thinks maybe if you experience it again, you'll realize it's not as amazing as you remember and you'll stop obsessing."

"That's not going to happen."

"I know. He's wrong about that." Areeba moved to Ayesha's desk chair and sat down stiffly. "Which is why this is a terrible idea. But apparently I'm doing it anyway."

She took a shaky breath, her hands gripping the armrests.

"He's going to go to you now. For five minutes. I'll be right here, watching, timing it. And then he comes back. Understood?"

"Understood."

"And Ayesha?" Areeba's eyes met hers, hard and hurt. "After this, I don't want to see you for a while. I can't—I can't look at you and not feel betrayed. So after this, you stay away from me."

The words hit like a slap, but Ayesha nodded.

She'd deal with the consequences later.

Right now, all she could think about was the promise of that connection. That warmth. That beautiful, terrible feeling of not being alone.

Areeba's expression went distant, her jaw clenching. Having a conversation Ayesha couldn't hear. Saying goodbye, probably. Preparing to be empty.

And then—

Ayesha gasped as the presence flooded into her mind.

*Hello again.*

Faisal's voice, warm and familiar, filling the hollow space she'd been carrying all week.

Relief hit her so hard she nearly sobbed. It was like taking her first breath after drowning, like warmth after freezing, like coming home after being lost.

"Oh God," she whispered. "I missed this."

*I know.* His mental voice was gentle but tinged with concern. *Ayesha, we need to talk about—*

*No talking,* she thought desperately. *Just... just let me feel this. Please.*

She could sense his hesitation, but he stopped trying to speak. Just let his presence settle into her consciousness like it belonged there.

Across the room, Areeba sat rigid in the chair, her face pale and stricken. Watching Ayesha experience what she'd lost. Her hands were clenched so tight on the armrests her knuckles were white.

Ayesha knew she should feel guilty. Should be horrified at what she'd done to get this.

But all she felt was complete.

*This is wrong,* Faisal said quietly in her mind. *You know that, right?*

*I don't care.*

*You should. Look at your sister.*

Ayesha forced herself to look. Really look.

Areeba was crying. Silent tears streaming down her face as she stared at nothing, experiencing the emptiness Ayesha had felt all week. The emptiness that drove her to this.

"Areeba," Ayesha started to say out loud.

"Don't," Areeba whispered, her voice breaking. "Don't talk to me. Just—just enjoy your five minutes."

She looked so small in that chair. So devastated.

And suddenly, the beautiful fullness in Ayesha's mind felt less like a gift and more like theft.

*She's right to hate me,* Ayesha thought.

*She doesn't hate you. She's hurt. There's a difference.*

*I blackmailed her.*

*Yes. You did.*

The judgment in his mental voice—gentle but unmistakable—made Ayesha flinch.

*What's wrong with me?* she thought desperately. *Why can't I stop wanting this?*

*Because it's designed to be wanted,* Faisal said softly. *Connection. Companionship. The feeling of not being alone. These are fundamental human needs. And you got a taste of having them met in a way most people never experience. Of course you're craving it.*

*Then how does Areeba stand it? Knowing she could lose you any time?*

*She doesn't think about it. She just holds on as tight as she can.*

Ayesha looked at her sister again—still crying silently, still clenching the chair like it was the only thing keeping her grounded.

Holding on.

That's what Ayesha had taken from her. The ability to hold on.

"I'm sorry," Ayesha whispered. "Areeba, I'm so sorry."

"Four minutes left," Areeba said tonelessly. "Don't waste them apologizing."

*She's not going to forgive you,* Faisal said. *Not for a while.*

*I know.*

*Was it worth it?*

Ayesha wanted to say yes. Wanted to claim that these few minutes of connection were worth destroying her relationship with her sister.

But looking at Areeba's devastated face, she couldn't.

*No,* she thought. *It wasn't.*

*Then why did you do it?*

*Because I couldn't stop myself. Because the wanting was too strong. Because I'm weak and selfish and—*

*You're human,* Faisal interrupted gently. *Humans make mistakes.*

*This is more than a mistake.*

*Yes. It is.*

The honesty hurt, but Ayesha appreciated it more than empty comfort would have.

They sat in silence for the remaining minutes—Ayesha experiencing the connection she'd craved, Areeba enduring the emptiness she'd feared, and Faisal caught between them, belonging fully to neither while he was divided.

When Areeba's phone timer went off, the sound was shrill and final.

"Time's up," Areeba said. Her voice was hollow. "Faisal, come back. Now."

*I'm sorry,* Faisal said to Ayesha. *For what it's worth, I wish I could help. But I can't.*

*I know. Go. She needs you.*

The presence withdrew, and the emptiness rushed back in—worse than before, because now Ayesha had broken something precious to briefly fill it.

Areeba's face transformed as Faisal returned to her—color flooding back, tension releasing, the devastated emptiness replaced by relief so intense it was almost painful to watch.

She stood up shakily, wiping her eyes.

"There," she said. "You got what you wanted. Happy now?"

Ayesha shook her head, unable to speak around the lump in her throat.

"Good." Areeba moved toward the door, one hand pressed against her chest like she was making sure Faisal was really there. "Because I'm not happy. And I won't be. Not with you. Not for a long time."

"Areeba—"

"Stay away from me, Ayesha. I mean it. I can't—" Her voice broke. "I can't do this anymore. I can't have you looking at me like you want to steal the one good thing in my life. So just... stay away."

She left, closing the door quietly behind her.

Ayesha sat on her bed, empty and ashamed, listening to her sister's footsteps fade down the hall.

She'd gotten what she wanted.

Five minutes of connection.

And in exchange, she'd lost her sister's trust, her own self-respect, and any moral high ground she'd had to stand on.

The trade wasn't worth it.

But she'd do it again in a heartbeat, and that terrified her most of all.

Because now she understood something about addiction that no lecture or warning could have taught her:

Sometimes you know exactly what you're destroying.

And you do it anyway.

Because the need is stronger than the knowing.

And the wanting doesn't care about the cost.
