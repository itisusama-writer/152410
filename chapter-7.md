# CHAPTER 7: THE GUARDIAN

The road to Babusar Top was worse than anything they'd experienced so far.

If the journey to Saif-ul-Malook had been uncomfortable, this was punishing. The jeeps crawled up switchbacks so tight the drivers had to reverse and adjust multiple times. The drop-offs were sheer and terrifying—thousands of feet of empty air with nothing but faith and bald tires between the passengers and oblivion.

Aunt Sadia had her eyes closed and her lips moving in constant prayer. Aunt Fareeda gripped the handle above her door so tightly her knuckles had gone white. Even the children were subdued, Hiba's earlier excitement dampened by genuine fear.

The landscape transformed as they climbed. The lush pine forests gave way to sparse vegetation, then to bare rock and patches of snow that clung to shadowed crevices even in summer. The sky deepened to a blue so intense it looked artificial.

And the air grew thin. So thin.

Ayesha felt it in her lungs—each breath requiring conscious effort, never quite satisfying. Her head throbbed with a persistent ache that even the pills Aunt Fareeda had given her couldn't touch. Around her, she could see the same struggle in everyone else. Labored breathing. Pale faces. The altitude was affecting them all.

Everyone except Areeba.

She sat beside Hiba, perfectly comfortable, pointing out landmarks to the little girl in a cheerful voice that showed no breathlessness. Her color was good. Her movements fluid and energetic.

Impossible, Ayesha thought. At nearly 12,000 feet and climbing, everyone should be struggling.

They stopped at a checkpoint where a lone guard in a weathered uniform waved them through after a cursory check of documents. The jeeps pulled over briefly to let everyone stretch and acclimate.

Ayesha climbed out on shaky legs, immediately hit by a wall of cold that took her breath away. The temperature had dropped dramatically. What had been pleasantly cool in Naran was now genuinely frigid. The wind cut through her shawl like it wasn't there.

Around her, the family bundled into jackets and shawls, shivering and gasping in the thin air. Uncle Jamil looked pale and slightly green. Faizan was bent over, hands on his knees, breathing hard.

Areeba stood by the jeep, arms wrapped around herself, shivering visibly.

"So cold," she muttered, her teeth chattering. "So cold. I can't—"

She turned away from the group, facing the jeep, and Ayesha saw her lips move. Heard the whispered words carried on the mountain wind.

"It's so cold. It's your turn now."

Areeba's whole body went rigid for just a second. Her shoulders straightened. Her shivering stopped abruptly, like someone had flipped a switch.

When she turned back around, her expression had changed. The discomfort was gone. Replaced by that assessing, confident look Ayesha had come to recognize as Faisal.

He rolled Areeba's shoulders, testing them. Took a deep breath of the thin air and let it out slowly, unbothered by the altitude. Then he walked to the edge of the overlook and stared out at the mountains with an expression of pure satisfaction.

"Beautiful," he said, loud enough for the others to hear. But the tone was wrong—too deep with appreciation, too masculine in its assessment.

Uncle Tariq joined him at the edge. "You're handling the altitude well, beta. Not feeling sick?"

Faisal shook his head, still staring at the view. "I feel great." He glanced at Uncle Tariq. "You don't look so good though, Uncle."

Uncle Tariq laughed weakly. "I'm getting too old for this. Stick to me, would you? In case I need someone to carry me back."

"No problem," Faisal said, and something in his voice suggested he meant it literally.

They climbed back into the jeeps and continued upward. The road deteriorated further—less road now, more suggestion of where wheels had gone before. The jeeps rocked and bounced, throwing everyone around despite their grip on seats and handles.

Ayesha watched the switching happen twice more during the climb.

The first time was subtle. Faisal had been in control, his posture confident, his breathing unaffected. Then Hiba asked Areeba to help her with a tangled bracelet. For a moment, Faisal's expression flickered with something like confusion—he clearly had no idea how to fix a child's bracelet.

Then Areeba's eyes softened. Her hands, which had been resting casually on her knees in a masculine sprawl, moved together and reached for the bracelet with practiced gentleness.

"Let me see, sweetheart," Areeba's voice said, warm and familiar.

She untangled the bracelet with deft fingers, explaining to Hiba how to avoid knotting it next time, her whole demeanor transformed back into the nurturing cousin Ayesha knew.

The switch had been seamless. No jerking, no slapping. Just a smooth transition, like two people trading seats.

They'd practiced this, Ayesha realized with a chill. They'd gotten good at it.

The second switch happened when they passed an especially terrifying section of road. A landslide had partially destroyed the path, leaving barely enough room for the jeep to squeeze through with inches to spare on either side. On the left, a rock wall. On the right, nothing but air and a drop that seemed to go on forever.

Aunt Sadia whimpered. Hiba buried her face in Areeba's side.

Areeba wrapped her arms around the little girl, murmuring comfort. "It's okay, baby. The driver knows what he's doing. We're safe."

But Ayesha saw Areeba's free hand clench into a fist. Saw her jaw tighten. Saw the flicker of fear cross her face—real fear, the kind Areeba would feel.

The kind Faisal wouldn't.

"I've got this," Ayesha heard her whisper to herself. Too quiet for anyone else to hear over the engine and Aunt Sadia's prayers. "Let me handle it."

Areeba's expression smoothed out. Her fist unclenched. She continued holding Hiba, but her body language changed—became more alert, more ready. Like a bodyguard instead of a comforting cousin.

Faisal was back, protecting them through the dangerous passage.

Once they were through, Ayesha saw Areeba's shoulders relax slightly. Heard the whisper again: "Okay, I'm back. Thank you."

The gratitude in that whisper made Ayesha's chest tight. Areeba was thanking her possessor. Thanking him for protecting them.

They were becoming partners.

---

After three and a half grueling hours, the jeeps finally crested the last rise and Babusar Top spread before them.

It wasn't like Saif-ul-Malook with its fairy-tale lake. This was harsher. Starker. More alien. A high mountain pass surrounded by peaks that looked like they could scrape the belly of heaven. Snow clung to everything, brilliant white against dark rock and that impossible blue sky. The wind howled constantly, a living thing that pushed and pulled with indifferent force.

"13,691 feet!" the driver announced proudly as they parked in a rough lot where several other vehicles huddled together. "Top of the world!"

The family disembarked slowly, carefully, bodies struggling against altitude and exhaustion. The cold hit like a physical blow—far worse than at the checkpoint. This wasn't just cold. This was the kind of cold that found every gap in clothing, every exposed inch of skin, and attacked it mercilessly.

"I can't breathe," Aunt Fareeda gasped, one hand on the jeep for support.

"Small breaths," Uncle Jamil instructed, though he looked like he was struggling too. "Don't overdo it. The oxygen is half what it is at sea level."

They bundled together, a family unit in a hostile environment. The children clung to their mothers. The men formed a protective circle around the women. Even the usually boisterous male cousins were quiet, awed and overwhelmed by the brutal beauty around them.

Faisal stood slightly apart, Areeba's body perfectly still, face turned toward the wind like he was drinking it in. He didn't shiver. Didn't gasp for breath. Just stood there, absorbing it all with an expression of transcendent joy.

"Areeba, come here!" Aunt Fareeda called. "You'll freeze!"

Reluctantly, Faisal moved back to the group. Aunt Fareeda immediately wrapped an extra shawl around Areeba's shoulders, fussing over her like she was one of the children.

"You're not even shivering," Aunt Fareeda said, concerned. "That's not good. That can be a sign of hypothermia."

"I'm fine, Auntie," Faisal said, his voice gentle but firm. "I'm just... warm-blooded, I guess."

They explored the area in a tight group, no one willing to stray far from the others. There was a small market here—a handful of stalls selling chai, corn, and souvenirs to the trickle of tourists brave or crazy enough to make the journey. The vendors huddled around portable heaters, wrapped in so many layers they looked twice their actual size.

"Chai?" one vendor called out, his breath misting. "Fresh, hot chai! Warm your bones!"

The offer was too good to refuse. They crowded into the man's small stall, grateful for the heat radiating from his portable stove. He served them chai in chipped cups, the liquid so hot it burned going down, but none of them cared. The warmth was worth it.

Ayesha wrapped her hands around her cup, trying to stop her fingers from going numb. Beside her, Areeba sipped her chai with a thoughtful expression.

"You should drink it faster," Faisal's voice said quietly. "Before it cools. The heat will help your body temperature."

Ayesha looked at him sharply. Practical advice. Survival advice. The kind of thing Areeba wouldn't necessarily know.

"Thanks," she said, her voice flat.

Faisal's lips quirked in something that wasn't quite a smile. "You're welcome."

They finished their chai and ventured back out into the cold. Uncle Jamil wanted photos—the whole family together at Babusar Top. They arranged themselves on a relatively flat area with the mountains as backdrop, bundled and shivering, trying to smile for the camera.

"Say cheese!" Uncle Jamil called.

"PANEER!" the kids yelled back, and everyone laughed despite the cold.

The laughter died quickly as a group of young men approached from one of the other parked vehicles. Five of them, probably in their mid-twenties, wearing expensive jackets and carrying DSLRs. City boys on an adventure, their swagger suggesting this wasn't their first mountain trip.

They walked past the family, and Ayesha noticed their eyes lingering—on Aunt Fareeda, on Aunt Sadia, on herself and Areeba. Assessing. Appreciating in a way that made her skin crawl.

One of them, tall with a carefully groomed beard, deliberately walked close to Aunt Sadia, forcing her to step aside. His friends laughed.

"Excuse you," Uncle Jamil said, his voice carrying a warning.

"Sorry, Uncle," the bearded man said, not sounding sorry at all. His eyes were still on the women. "Didn't see you there."

They moved on, heading toward the vendor stalls, but Ayesha saw them looking back, talking among themselves, laughing.

"Jaahil," Aunt Fareeda muttered. Ignorant.

"City boys who think they own everything," Uncle Tariq agreed, his jaw tight.

They tried to continue with photos, but the mood had soured. The men stayed visible in the background, their voices carrying across the wind, making comments just loud enough to hear but not loud enough to definitively confront.

"Should have brought my sister on this trip..."

"...Check out the one in the blue..."

"Mountain girls are different, yaar..."

Uncle Jamil's expression darkened. "Stay close, everyone. We'll take our photos and leave."

But as they were arranging for another group shot, the bearded man and one of his friends wandered back, positioning themselves deliberately in the frame of every photo Uncle Jamil tried to take.

"Excuse me," Uncle Jamil said, his patience fraying. "We're trying to take family photos."

"Oh, sorry, sorry!" The bearded man moved—but only a few feet, still close enough to be intrusive. His friend openly stared at Ayesha and Areeba, his gaze making Ayesha want to wrap her shawl tighter around herself.

"Let's just go," Aunt Sadia said quietly. "Please."

They started gathering their things, preparing to retreat to the jeeps. The harassment had been subtle—no overt threats, nothing they could definitively call out—but effective enough to ruin their experience.

Ayesha was helping Hiba with her jacket when she heard Aunt Fareeda's sharp gasp.

She turned to see the bearded man standing too close to her aunt, his hand having "accidentally" brushed against her as he "stumbled" on the uneven ground.

"So sorry, Auntie," he said, his smirk contradicting his words. "These rocks are dangerous."

Uncle Jamil moved forward, anger flashing across his face. "That's enough—"

But someone else moved faster.

Areeba—or rather, Faisal—crossed the distance in three long strides and placed himself directly between the bearded man and Aunt Fareeda. Areeba's body was smaller, slighter than the man's, but the way Faisal held it—shoulders squared, stance wide, weight balanced—made it clear this was no frightened girl.

"Apologize," Faisal said, his voice low and deadly serious. "Properly."

The bearded man blinked, surprised. Then he laughed. "What? Look at this, boys! The little girl wants to play hero!"

His friends had noticed the confrontation and were walking over, grins on their faces, sensing entertainment.

"Areeba, come here," Uncle Jamil said, trying to defuse the situation. "Let me handle this."

But Faisal didn't move. His eyes—Areeba's eyes, but with something ancient and dangerous behind them—stayed locked on the bearded man.

"I said apologize. To the lady. Now."

The bearded man's smile faltered. Something in Areeba's stance, in the absolute lack of fear in her voice, made him uncertain. "Or what? What are you going to do, little girl?"

"Faisal, don't—" Ayesha started, then caught herself. But it was too late.

Faisal had heard his name. A small smile crossed Areeba's face—cold and predatory.

"Or I'll make you," he said simply.

The bearded man laughed again, but it sounded forced now. He moved forward, reaching out to push Areeba aside—

Faisal caught his wrist.

The movement was so fast Ayesha almost missed it. One moment the man was reaching, the next his wrist was trapped in Areeba's small hand, and the man's face had gone white with pain.

"What—" he gasped, trying to pull free. He couldn't. Areeba's fingers were locked around his wrist like iron.

"Apologize," Faisal repeated, his voice calm. He applied more pressure, and the bearded man actually whimpered.

"Let go of him!" one of the friends moved forward.

"Stay back," Uncle Jamil commanded, his shock giving way to protective instinct. He and Uncle Tariq positioned themselves between the other men and Areeba, even though they had no idea what was happening.

The bearded man tried to wrench his arm free, tried to use his size and weight advantage. Faisal didn't budge. He twisted the wrist slightly—some kind of joint lock that Ayesha had only seen in action movies—and the man cried out, actually dropping to one knee.

"I'm sorry!" he gasped. "I'm sorry, okay? Let go!"

"To her," Faisal said, nodding toward Aunt Fareeda. "Not to me."

The man, his face red with pain and humiliation, looked at Aunt Fareeda. "I'm sorry, Auntie. I'm very sorry. It was wrong. Please—"

Faisal released him.

The bearded man stumbled backward, cradling his wrist, his friends catching him. They all stared at Areeba with expressions mixing confusion, fear, and wounded masculine pride.

"How did you—" the bearded man started.

"Leave," Faisal said quietly. "Now. Before I really get angry."

The threat, coming from a woman half their size, should have been laughable. But something in Areeba's eyes, in her posture, in the absolute confidence with which she'd just dominated a man twice her size, made it terrifying.

They left. Quickly. Practically running back to their vehicle, the bearded man still clutching his wrist.

Silence fell over the family.

Everyone was staring at Areeba. At sweet, gentle Areeba who'd never been in a fight in her life. Areeba who squealed at spiders. Areeba who'd just executed a joint lock that could have broken a man's wrist.

"Areeba," Uncle Jamil said slowly. "What... how did you do that?"

Faisal looked down at Areeba's hands, flexing the fingers like he was surprised by what they'd accomplished. Then that cold confidence melted away, and Areeba's usual expression flooded back—confused, a little scared, uncertain.

The switch had happened in the span of a heartbeat.

"I... I don't know," Areeba said, her voice small and shaky. She looked at her own hand like it belonged to someone else. "He was going to hurt Aunt Fareeda and I just... I reacted. I didn't think."

"Where did you learn to do that?" Faizan asked, awed and a little frightened. "That was like something from a movie!"

"I don't know," Areeba repeated. She looked at Aunt Fareeda, her eyes filling with tears. "Are you okay, Auntie? Did he hurt you?"

"I'm fine, beta," Aunt Fareeda said, her voice unsteady. She pulled Areeba into a hug. "You... you saved me. I don't know how, but you saved me."

Over Aunt Fareeda's shoulder, Areeba's eyes met Ayesha's. And in them, Ayesha saw both—Areeba's genuine concern for her aunt, and beneath it, Faisal's satisfaction at having protected someone under his care.

Two souls, one body. Working together now not just to coexist, but to protect.

"We should go," Uncle Tariq said, glancing toward where the men had fled. Their jeep was starting up, backing away quickly. "Before they come back with reinforcements or call the police."

They hurried to their own jeeps, the cold and altitude forgotten in the adrenaline rush. As they piled in, Ayesha heard the whispers again—Areeba talking to herself, or rather, to her passenger.

"Thank you for protecting her."

A pause.

"That's what family does."

Another pause.

"We're not family."

"No. But she is. And you care about her. So I care about her."

The logic was twisted, impossible, wrong. But also, in some strange way, touched by grace.

As the jeeps began their descent from Babusar Top, Ayesha leaned her head back and closed her eyes. Her mind spun with what she'd just witnessed.

Faisal had used Areeba's body to fight. Had accessed knowledge and skills Areeba didn't possess. Had dominated a grown man with the form of a slight woman.

And more terrifyingly—he'd done it to protect the family.

Not to hurt. Not to show off. But to protect.

What did that mean? What was he? A demon protecting the family he'd invaded? A spirit forming bonds with people who weren't even his?

The questions multiplied with every switchback descent, every meter they dropped back toward breathable air and sane reality.

Beside her, Areeba sat quietly, staring out the window. Her lips moved occasionally in those silent conversations. Her hands rested peacefully in her lap.

She looked so normal.

So completely, utterly normal.

Except she wasn't.

And Ayesha had no idea what to do about it.
